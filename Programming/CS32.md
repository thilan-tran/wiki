## Linking and Multiple Compilation
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib>
#include <math>
using namespace std;

// Circle.h "Header File"

class Circle
{
  public:
    Circle(double x, double y, double r);
    bool scale(double factor);
    void draw() const;
    double radius() const; // when you call this member function, it promises not to modify the object
                           // when first designing functions, always consider if they should be declared const

    // now let's try and make sure data can never be in a bad state
    // always document restrictions / invariants

    // Class invariant:
    //   m_r > 0 (check boundary cases)

  private:
    double m_x;
    double m_y;
    double m_r;
};

// double area(Circle x);     // non-member function, passing by value, x is a copy of a Circle
// double area(Circle& x);    // passing by reference, x is another name for an existing Circle, cheaper
double area(const Circle& x); // passing by constant reference, x is another name, promises not to modify x, cheaper
                              // still won't compile, area() calls radius() which is not a const function!

// now let's implement Circle class and area()
// interface (what) vs. implementation (how)

// Circle.cpp "Implementation File"

#include "Circle.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
#include <math>
using namespace std;

Circle::Circle(double x, double y, double r)
  : m_x(x), m_y(y), m_r(r) // member initialization list, alternate syntax, can have an empty function body following, executes before function body
{
  if (r <= 0) // how do we deal with this issue? constructors don't have a return value
              // can't use a default value, unstated rule is for constructor not to return normally if constructor doesn't create a meaningful object
              // could use exceptions in this case, but out of the scope of this class
  {
    cerr << "Cannot create a circle with radius " << r << endl;
    exit(1);
  }
  // m_x = x;
  // m_y = y;
  // m_r = r;
}

bool Circle::scale(double factor)
{
  if (factor <= 0) // how do we deal with this issue? can return a bool (not a constructor)
                   // check boundary! we decided circle of radius 0 is invalid
    return false;
  m_r *= factor;
  return true;
}

void Circle::draw() const
{
  ...
}

double Circle::radius() const
{
  return m_r;
}

double area(Circle x)
{
  const double PI = 4 * atan(1.0);
  return PI * x.radius() * x.radius();
}

// let's say above code and main routine are on separate files
// how to get it to compile?

// myapp.cpp

#include "Circle.h" // double quotes references an actual file somewhere
#include <iostream> // angle brackets references some predefined directories, compiler specific
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  Circle c(8, -3, 3.7);
  Circle d(-2, 5, 10);
  d.scale(2);     // some people argue to always test for valid return values
  // d.m_r = -10; // how do we prevent this? public / private distinction
                  // now won't compile, main() isn't a member function
                  // but how can area() access the m_r member now?
                  // use a public accessor function
                  // possible language alternative: what if private variables were accessible but not modifiable?
                  // then it's very difficult to change implementations! principle of abstraction
  d.draw();
  cout << area(d);
  double e;
  cin >> e;
  if(!d.scale(e)) // now we can check if scale() was valid
    ...
}
```

- normally, compiler takes c++ source code (.cpp), translates to an object file (.obj)
- object file is still not executable, example code only has code for the main routine
  - object file defines the main routine
  - object file needs the implementations for
    - Circle::Circle()
    - Circle::scale()
    - Circle::draw()
    - area()
    - operator `<<`
  - some of these implementations are found in the library code: defines `<<`, other standard library functions
- object file must be linked with the library code to generate an executable (linker)
- if Circle's functions still aren't implemented, building will generate a linker error, **not** a compilation error
  - implementing functions more than once is another linker error
- preferably, split large programs across multiple files
  - compiling and linking many object files is better than compiling one large file (_separate compilation_)
  - will reuse different up-to-date object files instead of recompiling and then relink (_relinking faster than recompilation_)

### Header Files

- in example code, compiling the two files creates two object files that satisfy each other
  - but we would have had to declare the entire Circle class **twice**
  - use _header files_!
    - for every class, convention is to have a header file and implementation file
    - #include "Header.h" acts as if entire header file code has been copied here, shorthand
    - don't have to explicitly compile header files!
      - eg. command line compilation: g32 -o myapp myapp.cpp Circle.cpp
      - or g32 -o myapp \*.cpp
      - using \* as a wildcard
- **never** #include .cpp files!
  - can lead to multiple defined functions

### Include Guards

```c++
// Point.h
// =======

#ifndef POINT_INCLUDED // "include guard"
#define POINT_INCLUDED
class Point
{
  ...
};
#endif  // POINT_INCLUDED

// Circle.h
// ========

#ifndef CIRCLE_INCLUDED
#define CIRCLE_INCLUDED

#include "Point.h"

class Circle
{
  ...
  Point m_center;
  double m_r;
}
#endif  // CIRCLE_INCLUDED

// myapp.cpp
// =========

// #include "Point.h" // bad rule, necessitates including both header files to use Circle class, and Point.h before Circle.h
#include "Circle.h"
// #include "Point.h" // this would lead to a multiple defined linking error! declares Point class twice
#include "Point.h"    // this is fine after adding include guards

int main()
{
  Circle c(...);
  Point p(...);
  ...
}
```

- As a general rule, header files should **always** include other header files they need to compile
- but could lead to errors when including both Circle.h and Point.h
  - can use _include guards_ with #ifndef, #endif
  - include guard is not necessary when multiple .cpp files include the same file
  - every header's include guard name should have different names
  - convention of #define HEADER_INCLUDED

### Circular Dependency

```c++
// Student.h
// =========

#ifndef STUDENT_INCLUDED
#define STUDENT_INCLUDED

// #include "Course.h" // needs to know what a course is, leads to circular dependency

class Course;

class Student
{
  ...
  void enroll(Cource* cp);
  ...
  Course* m_studyList[10];
  ...
};
#endif  // STUDENT_INCLUDED

// Course.h
// ========

#ifndef COURSE_INCLUDED
#define COURSE_INCLUDED

// #include "Student.h" // needs to know what a student is, leads to circular dependency

class Student;

class Course
{
  ...
  Student* m_roster[1000];
  ...
};
#endif  // COURSE_INCLUDED

// blah.cpp
// ========

#include "Student.h"
#include "Course.h"

void f(Student* sp, Course* cp)
{
  sp->enroll(cp);
}

// foo.cpp  fine to have multiple includes and incomplete type declarations
//==========

#include <iostream>
#include <iostream>
#include <iostream>
class A;
class A;
class A // but only one actual declaration of class A
{
  ...
};
```

- _circular dependency_! will not resolve by including headers
- the compiler just needs to know how big the class declarations are
  - but all pointers to class types are the **same** size
  - thus, don't need to know all the details of a class to use a pointer to that class
    - or to use a class as a *parameter or a return type*
  - so convention is to use incomplete type declarations whenever possible (**cheaper**)
    - avoid unnecessary #include's
  - as soon as details of a class are necessary, the header file **must** be included
    - eg. using member functions, constructors, etc.

## Constructing with Member Initialization Lists

```c++
class Circle
{
  public:
    Circle(double x, double y, double r);
    ...
  private:
    double m_x;
    double m_y;
    double m_r;
};

Circle::Circle(double x, double y, double r);
  : m_x(x), m_y(y)
{
  m_r = r;
}

class StickFigure
{
  public:
    StickFigure(double bl, double headDiam, std::string nm, double hx, double hy);
  private:
    std::string m_name;
    Circle m_head;
    double m_bodyLength;
};

StickFigure:: StickFigure(double bl, double headDiam, std::string nm, double hx, double hy)
  : m_name(nm), m_head(hx, hy, headDiam/2), m_bodyLength(bl)
  // must initialize m_head here, m_name is optional to initialize here
  // good practice to initialize everything here
{
  // m_name = nm; // first empty string then assignment, slightly more expensive
  // m_x = hx;    // private members of Circle! can't use simple assignment
  // m_y = hy;
  // m_r = headDiam / 2;
  // m_head = ??? // already previously constructed with default constructor (won't compile, didn't exist)
  // m_bodyLength = bl;
  ...
}

struct Employee
{
  string name;
  double salary;
  int age;
};

Employee e;

// ====== compiler-written constructor:
// Employee::Employee()
// {}

Circle c(-2, 5, 10);
// first m_x and m_y are initialized in member initialization list, then m_r is updated in constructor body

StickFigure sf(5, 4, "Fred", -2, 7);
// m_name first empty string, then "Fred"
// but if assigned using member initalizer list, doesn't call default constructor, cheaper
```

- construction/assignment nuances
  - for built-in types, **simple**: just change the contents
    - doesn't matter if value is assigned later in body or initialized
  - for class types, **different**:
    - whenever object of a class type is declared/created, a constructor is **always** called
    - when assigning to a class type, it's an _already_ constructed object, assignment != construction
    - eg. string starts out with empty string
    - for member objects in a class, may **have** to use member initialization list to construct them with parameters
  - recall: if you declare no constructors at all, the compiler writes a zero-argument constructor (default constructor)
- steps of construction:
  1. construct the base object
  2. construct each data member, consulting the _member initialization list_
  - if not listed:
    - built-in type: left uninitialized
    - class type: default-constructed (having no default constructor is an **error**)
  3. execute _body of constructor_

## Writing a String type a la Smallberg

```c++
class String
{
  public:
    // String();                   // should empty string have a nullptr or a pointer to a zero byte?
                                   // nullptr is cheaper/faster (more users benefit), pointer to zero byte acts like any other String (programmer benefits)

    String(const char* text = ""); // can use a default parameter instead of a default constructor
                                   // acts as a constructor that can be called without arguments, default constructor!
                                   // default constructor means a constructor that CAN be called with zero arguments

    // String(String other);       // WRONG syntax for copy constructor, won't compile! cyclical, needs to call itself as a copy constructor
    String(const String& other);   // correct copy constructor syntax using a const reference

    ~String();

    // void assign(const String& rhs);      // right hand side
    // void operator=(const String& rhs);   // we want to chain operator
    // String operator=(const String& rhs); // creates an extra copy, wasteful
    String& operator=(const String& rhs);

    void swap(String& other);      // for copy and swap idiom

  private:
      // Class invariant: // always make sure to document all cases
      //  m_text points to a dynamically allocated array of m_len+1 chars
      //  m_len >= 0
      //  m_len == strlen(m_text)
    // char m_text[???];   // should there be a limit on the number of characters?
    char* m_text;         // now has a dynamic size
    int m_len;            // how to find end of the String? store size? append zero byte? why not both?
};

String::String(const char* text) // text is a pointer to constant chars!
{
  if (text == nullptr)        // let's produce empty string if nullptr was passed
    text = "";                // text can point to different places, but can't modify those chars
  m_len = strlen(text);
  // m_text = text;           // WRONG! can't just copy the pointer, m_text then could have its string value changed elsewhere
                              // instead, m_text should hold its own char array
  m_text = new char[m_len+1]; // can use a non constant array size when using new operator!
                              // char built-in-type, so uninitialized
  // Blah* bp = new Blah[n];  // on the other hand, default-constructors called n-times for the blah objects!
  strcpy(m_text, text);
}

// String::String()           // let's make this as similar to the other constructor as possible
// {
//   // m_len = 0;
//   m_len = strlen("");
//   // m_text = new char[1];
//   m_text = new char[m_len+1];
//   // m_text[0] = '\0';
//   strcpy(m_text, "");
//   // now we can actually combine the constructors into one!
// }

String::String(const String& other)
{
  m_len = other.m_len;      // yes, this member function can access the private data members of any String
  // m_text = other.m_text; // no, this leads to the same issue as the compiler generated copy constructor, memory leaks
  m_text = new char[m_len+1];
  strcpy(m_text, other.m_text);

  // m_len = other.size();  // could alternatively copy using only member functions, but could be much less efficient!
  // m_text = new char[m_len+1];
  // for (int k = 0; k < m_len; k++)
  //   m_text[k] = other.charAt(k);
  // m_text[m_len] = '\0';
}

String::~String()
{
  // delete m_text; // BUT different forms of delete!
                    // for single dynamic objects, use delete p;
                    // for array of dynamic objects, use delete [] p;
  delete [] m_text;
}

// void String::assign(const String& rhs)    // we want to allow chaining operator
String& String::operator=(const String& rhs) // operator notation, overloaded assignment operator
                                             // can only overload existing operators
                                             // eg. s.operator[](k); equivalent to s[k];
{
  if (this != &rhs)
  {
    // delete [] m_text;                     // no more memory leak
    // m_len = rhs.m_len;
    // m_text = new char[m_len+1];
    // strcpy(m_text, rhs.m_text);

    String temp(rhs);                        // "copy-and-swap" approach for assignment operators
    swap(temp);                              // works better with assignment, checks for self assignment, elegant!
                                             // swap swaps the pointers
                                             // temp is destructed at the end
  }
  return *this;                              // allows for chaining assignment operator
}

void swap(String& other)
{
  char* temp = m_text;
  m_text = other.m_text;
  other.m_text = temp;

  int temp2 = m_len;
  m_len = other.m_len;
  other.m_len = temp2;
}

char* f(...); // returns a c-string

void h()
{
  String s("Hello"); // passing an array of characters to constructor
                     // double-quoted string literals already have a zero byte appended
  String s2;         // acts same as if String s2("");
  String s3(f(...)); // what if null pointer? (can test) or no zero byte? (can't really deal with this problem)
  ...
  char line[1000];
  cin.getline(line, 1000);
  String t(line);
  cin.getline(line, 1000); // will overwrite line! since t simply holds a pointer,
                           // t would now hold a different String if m_text was initialized by pointer assignment
}

void g()
{
  for (...)
    h();
} // memory leak! dynamically allocated memory isn't released! memory is a finite resource
  // "garbage" memory fills up over time unless there is a destructor
```

## Default Parameter Values

- void f(int i, double d)
- void f(int i)
- if these functions act the same as if f(int i, 3.7), can combine into the **same** function using default values:
  - void f(int i, double d = 3.7)
    - this acts as both a one **and** two argument function
    - defaults to value of 3.7 for d if called with only one argument
  - eg. void g(int i, Point p = Point(), double d = 3.7)
    - acts as a one, two, and three argument function
    - can call:
      - g(10, q, 4.8);
      - g(10, q); acts as g(10, q, 3.7)
      - g(10); acts as g(10, Point(), 3.7)
    - **cannot** call:
      - g(10, , 4.8);
  - once you have provide a default value for an argument, **all** the other following arguments must also contain default values
  - default values can be **any** expression (even dynamically allocated objects), not necessarily constant
  - only **cannot** depend on the other parameters
- default values only go in the prototype (header), **NOT** the implementation
- can lead to ambiguities/compile issues
  - eg. function with two parameters (one default), and same name function with only one parameter
    - **cannot** call that function with one argument

## Copy Constructors & Assignment Operator Overloading

```c++
// continued from String class above

void f(String t) // default copy construcctor copies the length and pointer to dynamic array from s to t
{
  // eg. t.set(0, 'J'); // here, value of s has changed out from under it! (because s and t both point to the same array)
  String u("WOW");
  ...
  // u = t;      // compiler generates an assignment operator that simply copies each data member from t into u
                 // in this case, leads to a memory leak: replaces and loses pointer to dynamic array ("WOW")
  // u.assign(t);// let's try writing a member function for assignment
  u = t;         // means u.operator=(t);
  ...
}                // t goes away at the end of a function, t's destructor is called, deletes dynamic array

void g()
{
  String s("Hello");
  f(s);
  ...
}                // tries to delete the same dynamic array, undefined behavior
                 // as it is, can't pass our String class by value (copy)
                 // solution: we have to write our own copy constructor that creates a new dynamic array

// all the following examples involve copies and have the same issues
// tries to delete the same dynamic arrays twice
String s("Hello");
String t(s);

String h()
{
  String x;
  ...
  return x;
}

// Ex. Overloading copy constructor from String class

String::String(const String& other)
{
  m_len = other.m_len;      // yes, this member function can access the private data members of any String
  // m_text = other.m_text; // no, this leads to the same issue as the compiler generated copy constructor
  m_text = new char[m_len+1];
  strcpy(m_text, other.m_text);

  // m_len = other.size();  // could alternatively copy using only member functions, but could be much less efficient!
  // m_text = new char[m_len+1];
  // for (int k = 0; k < m_len; k++)
  //   m_text[k] = other.charAt(k);
  // m_text[m_len] = '\0';
}

// Ex. Overloading assignment operator from String class

// void String::assign(const String& rhs)    // we want to allow chaining operator
String& String::operator=(const String& rhs) // operator notation, overloaded assignment operator
                                             // can only overload existing operators
                                             // eg. s.operator[](k); equivalent to s[k];
{
  if (this != &rhs)
  {
    // delete [] m_text;                     // no more memory leak
    // m_len = rhs.m_len;
    // m_text = new char[m_len+1];
    // strcpy(m_text, rhs.m_text);

    String temp(rhs);                        // "copy-and-swap" approach for assignment operators
    swap(temp);                              // works better with assignment, checks for self assignment, elegant
                                             // swap swaps the pointers
                                             // temp is destructed at the end
  }
  return *this;                              // allows for chaining assignment operator
}
```

### Copy Construction

- passing by value passes a **COPY**... how do copies work? copying is done by a _copy constructor_!
  - copy constructor creates an object based on another object
  - there are certain language constructs where copy constructor is called automatically (like default constructor)
    - eg. passing by value, returning an object, copy constructing ( String t(s); )
      - alternate syntax for copy construction String s3 = s1;
    - initializing a brand new object
  - compiler writes its own **default** copy constructor, simply copies each member into copy (_shallow copy_)
  - using compiler generated copy constructor with **dynamically** allocated objects can lead to issues
    - error trying to delete dynamic objects **multiple** times
  - using copy constructor on classes composed of other classes with their own copy constructor
    - **automatically** calls those specific classes' copy constructors

### Assignment Operator

- copying is **NOT** the same as assignment!
  - assignment operator does **NOT** call copy constructor
    - can only construct once
    - copy constructor theoretically wouldn't work in this case either, doesn't delete old dynamic memory
  - constructor: **nothing** in this to begin with (initialization)
  - assignment: there **is** stuff in this to begin with
  - compiler generated assignment operator copies each member (_shallow copy_)
  - make sure to check for errors from aliasing (don't sink your own ships)
- you can overload **operators** in c++
  - example syntax in prototype: void String::operator=(...)
    - eg. s.operator[](k)
  - can only overload **existing** operators
  - for assignment operator, convention is to return (\*this) as a String reference in order to allow for **chain** assignment
    - assignment associates from right to left
    - eg. i = j = k = 0;
  - have to ensure assigning an object to itself still works
    - eg. i = i;
    - otherwise, we may delete dynamic memory and then try to access there **again**

## Inline Methods

- inline function code is **embedded** directly into the calling function by the compiler (for speed)
  - all functions with their body defined in their class are automatically inline
  - speed up program, but may make the .exe file larger

```c++
inline int bar(int a) // in function prototype
inline int foo::bar(int a)
inline ItemType foo<ItemType>::bar(ItemType a)
```

# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Linked Lists

- types of arrays so far:
  - _fixed size_ array
    - number of elements **has** to be known at compile time
    - keep track of size
  - _dynamically allocated_ array
    - now number of elements **doesn't** have to be known at compile time
    - but, now have to keep track of current size _as well as_ max capacity
      - could be done with numbers or pointers
  - _resizeable_ array (vector)
    - when going over capacity, dynamically allocate a **larger** array
      - how much to extend capacity by?
      - general rule of thumb, 1.5 \* current capacity
    - copy all items into new array
    - delete old array, reassign to new array and increase capacity
- Pros and Cons of Arrays
  - **Pros**
    - same time to access each element
      - compiler knows where elements are stored contiguously
    - easy to add to the end of the array
  - **Cons**
    - hard to _maintain the order_, such as inserting in the **middle** or **beginning**
  - weigh pros and cons when considering data structures!
  - difficult to insert in the middle because memory for an array **is** contiguous
- how to make a data structure where the memory is incontiguous?
  - each value could hold a pointer to the next!
  - 65 -> 35 -> 69 -> 420 -> 666
  - how to signify end of the sequence? use nullptr
  - have a variable hold the first element of the list

### Possible Approaches

- this is a **linked list**!
  - **first** element: **head** / **front**
  - each element is a **node**
  - **last** element: **tail** / **back**
  - to insert in the middle, instead of having to shift elements:
    - allocate a **new** node
    - put data of interest in **new** node
    - **new** node points to previous node's next node
    - previous node points to **new** node
  - only way to traverse right now is **forward** through the pointers, one step at a time
  - can't jump into the **middle** of the list
  - other considerations:
    - save pointer to the last node if doing operations often around the tail
      - but in a one item list, head = tail
    - have each node also point to the previous node (_doubly-linked list_)
      - much easier to insert and delete
      - don't have to go through the loop again to find the previous node
      - can also travel **backwards**
    - make a _circular list_
      - last node points back to the head
      - _no more nullptr's_, fewer special considerations (but head, tail, empty **still** special cases)
    - add a _dummy node_
      - even though it doesn't hold a value, now there is **always** at least one node present
      - _no more special cases_!
      - acts as a placeholder
      - no longer needs a tail pointer

### General Tips

- **Tips**:
  - general rule: any time you write p->something, _make sure to check_
    - p has previously been **given** a value
    - p is **not** the nullptr
  - **draw** diagrams!
    - check _typical situation_ (activity in the middle), at the head, at the tail
    - emtpy list, one-element list
  - don't do things in the _wrong order_
    - general rule: set values in the new node **first**

### Implementation

```c++
struct Node
{
  int   data;
  Node* next; // this is fine to the compiler, but can't have a node within a node
};

struct Node   // doubly-linked list
{
  int   data;
  Node* next; // successor
  Node* prev; // predecessor
}

Node* head;   // head points to the first element
              // if head == nullptr, list is empty

// Print out all values of the list

// while (head != nullptr)
// {
//   cout << head->data << endl;
//   head = head->next;
// }          // but now we can't go backwards, we lost head pointer!

for (Node* p = head; p != nullptr; p = p->next)
  cout << p->data << endl;

// Find an element of the list

Node* p;
for (p = head; p != nullptr && p->data != 42; p = p->next)
  ;
if (p == nullptr)
  cout << "Target value is not in the list" << endl;
else
  cout << "p->data is " << p->data << endl;
// check for nullptr everywhere! can't cout a nullptr
// what if the element isn't in the list?
// would this work with an empty list?
// short-circuit with p != nullptr!

// Insert element after another

Node* p;
for (p = head; p != nullptr && p->data != 42; p = p->next)
  ;
if (p != nullptr)
{
  Node* newGuy = new Node;
  newGuy->data = 32;
  newGuy->next = p->next;
  p->next = newGuy;
}
```

## Stacks and Queues

- collection of data, but with a **limited** possibility of actions
- if so, implementing the data structure could be **simpler**

### Stacks

- eg. the data structure runtime has to maintain:
  - calling a function suspends the current function
  - opens a new environment for the new function
  - falls back to the previous environment
  - all additions and removals happen at the **end** of the structure!
- new items **always** inserted at the end, only **last** item can be removed
- **LIFO** - _last in, first out_
- this is a **stack**!
- **Stack**:
  - create an empty stack
  - push an item onto a stack
  - pop an item from the stack (only when not empty)
  - look at the top item on the stack (only when not empty)
  - is the stack empty?
- more possible stack functionalities
  - how many items are in the stack?
  - look at any item in the stack

### Queues

- what about similar, but with waiting in line? (first in line is served first)
- new items **always** inserted at the end, but only **first** item can be removed
- **FIFO** - _first in, first out_
- this is a **queue**!
- **Queue**:
  - create an empty queue
  - enqueue an item (at the tail / back)
  - dequeue an item (from the head / front) (only when not empty)
  - look at front item in the queue (no need to look at back of the queue) (only when not empty)
  - is the queue empty?
- more possible queue functionalities
  - how many items are in the queue?
  - look at the back item in the queue
  - look at any item in the queue
- these aren't low level data structures, both can be **implemented** with arrays or linked lists
- these have limitations, rather than _general purpose_ arrays / linked lists

### Priority Queues

- _priority queue_ - extension of queue, every item has a _priority value_
  - items of same priority ordered by **FIFO** (so a queue)
- eg. printer printing pages: 1000, 1, 1
  - if treated as a normal queue, average wait time would be ~1000 for each print job
  - if instead we **prioritize** shorter print jobs, average wait time would be ~350 for each print job
    - should also include an "aging scheme" so that items in the queue for a long time eventually get processed
- unsorted sequence:
  - _insertion_: O(1) (just push end)
  - _remove_: O(N) (find highest priority item)
- sorted sequence:
  - _insertion_: O(N) (insert in order)
  - _remove_: O(1) (just pop end)
- BST:
  - _insertion_: O(logN)
  - _remove_: O(logN)
  - but if we're always approaching from the top side of the BST, high time complexity to rebalance the tree...
    - use a **heap**!

### Syntax

```c++
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  stack<int> s;
  s.push(10);
  s.push(20);
  int n = s.top(); // n == 20
  s.pop();         // void! (varies with different libraries / languages)
  if (!s.empty())
    cout << s.size();
}

#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(10);        // not enqueue / dequeue
  q.push(20);
  int n = q.front(); // n == 10
  q.pop();
  if (!q.empty())
  {
    cout << q.size() << endl;
    cout << q.back() << endl; // c++ allows this
  }
}
```

### Stack Implementations

- with an **array**:
  - have to maintain capacity and current size
  - to push, assign value and increment size
  - to pop, simply **decrement** the counter
  - thus top is the "end" of array
- with a **linked list**:
  - maintain just head pointer
  - to push, add node to the head, not the tail
  - thus treat the head as the top, **easiest** to get to
  - to pop, remove node from head

### Queue Implementations

- with an **array**:
  - have to maintain capacity, head, and tail
  - head at position 0, tail at position one beyond last item in queue
    - number of items in queue then just tail - head
    - to enqueue, assign value and increment tail
    - if tail moved up to capacity
      - should we shift head and tail back to the beginning of the array?
      - could be array space usable before the head
      - eg. size of 2, but 98 spaces earlier in array with values that have been dequeued
      - instead, treat the array **circularly** and wrap back around!
      - called "_circular array_" or "_ring buffer_"
      - if head == tail, queue is either empty or full, how to distinguish?
      - instead maintain another variable for the current size
  - when dequeueing, would have to shift all values backwards
    - instead, simply _shift the head forward_!
    - head is position of the first item in queue
- with a **linked list**:
  - maintain head and tail pointers
  - to enqueue, add node to tail
  - to dequeue, remove node from head
  - unique case when empty or one element (_boundary case_)
  - usually no dummy node, singly linked (but tail still points to the end)

## Evaluating Expressions with Algorithms

- eg. sample custom expression for a database could be:
  - dept = 'IT' and salary >= 70000 and name != 'SMITH'
- _Prefix Notation_:
  - does **not** need to consider precedence:
    - every operator takes a certain number of operands
  - f(x,y,z)
  - add(sub(8, div(6, 2)), 1)
  - \+ - 8 / 6 2 1
- _Infix Notation_:
  - **issues** with precedence and associativity
  - 8 - 6 / 2 + 1
- _Postfix Notation_:
  - does **not** need to consider precedence
  - 8 6 2 / - 1 +

### Evaluating Postfix Expression

- How do we parse through an infix expression _in one go_ to solve these expressions?
  - **translate** into postfix and do it!
  - eg. 8 6 2 / - 1 +
    - can use an _alogrithm with a stack_ to solve
    - ever operator should match with two operands immediately before it
    - going from left to right:
      - if at an operand, **push** it onto stack
      - if at an operator, **pop** its operands, and **push** the result of the expression
      - should end with a _single result_ in stack
    - 8 ~~6 2 /~~
    - ~~8 3 -~~
    - ~~5 1 +~~
    - 6

### Translating Infix to Postfix

- How do we **translate** an infix expression into postfix?
  - also use an _algorithm with a stack_
  - going from left to right:
    - if at an operand, put it in new postfix expression
    - if at an operator and stack is empty, **push** it onto the stack
    - otherwise if precedence is **strictly** higher than top of stack **push** it onto the stack
      - if top of stack is open parenthesis, always **push**
    - otherwise if precedence is not **strictly** higher than top of stack, **pop** it from the stack, check again
    - if come to open parenthesis, **push** it onto stack
    - if come to close parenthesis, **pop** until we come to an open parenthesis
    - at end, **pop** everything off the stack
  - eg. 8 - ( ( 2 + 1 ) \* 2 - 3 ) + 4
  - **Expression**: 8 2 1 + 2 \* 3 - - 4 +
  - **Operator Stack**: ~~-~~ ~~(~~ ~~( + )~~ ~~\*~~ ~~- )~~ ~~+~~

## Trees

- tree has a distinguished node (_root_), and one **unique** path from the root to **any** node
  - _parent_ / _child_ node relationships
  - _leaf_ node has no children vs. _interior_ node
  - _depth_ of a node
  - _height_ of the tree (max node _depth_)
- alternatively, every node _really only needs_ two pointers / children (left and right)
  - called a **binary tree**
- every node has **data** and **pointers** to indicate structure of a tree
- operations with trees can be done more easily with _recursion_
  - _base cases_ for trees:
    - empty tree, sometimes leaf nodes
  - _recursive cases_ must solve smaller problem:
    - fewer nodes / breaking down into sub-trees
    - shorter height
- information can be passed up or down the tree recursively
- **processing patterns**:
  - _pre-order traversal_:
    - process node => process children of that node
  - _in-order traversal_:
    - for binary trees: process left subtree => process the node => process right subtree
  - _post-order traversal_:
    - process children of a node => process that node (passing info up)
  - _level-order traversal_:
    - process each level's nodes from left to right => process next level
  - all O(N)
  - draw counter-clockwise loop around tree to visualize:
    - pre-order: dot on left
    - in-order: dot under
    - post-order: dot on right

### Example

```c++
struct Node
{
  string data;
  // Node* children[5];   // instead, variable number of children
  vector<Node*> children; // "singly-linked"
  Node* parent;           // "doubly-linked", optional
};

Node* root = nullptr;     // empty tree

// approach with a stack, or with recursion ...
int countNodes(const Node* t)
{
  if (t == nullptr)       // only base case is empty tree, leaf node handled generally
    return 0;
  int total = 1;
  for (int k = 0; k < t->children.size(); k++)
    total += countNodes(t->children[k]);
  return total;
}

// print indented list
void printTree(const Node* t, int depth = 0); // default parameter for depth in prototype

// void printTree(const Node* t) // have to keep track of depth for indents
void printTree(const Node* t, int depth)
{
  if (t != nullptr)
  {
    cout << string(2*depth, ' ') << t->data << endl; // temporary string with space chars
    for (int k = 0; k < t->children.size(); k++)
    {
      // cout << "  ";                       // won't work, subtrees don't know how deep they are
      // printTree(t->children[k], ++depth); // reassigning depth!
      printTree(t->children[k], depth+1);
    }
  }
}

// could overload printTree() with helper function
void printTree(const Node* t) { printTree(t, 0); }

int main()
{
  Node* windsor;
  ...
  printTree(windsor); // could overload printTree() or just use default parameter
}
```

### Binary Trees

- any valid tree can be represented as a binary tree
- either empty, or a node with a left binary subtree and a right binary subtree
- how to _convert_ a tree with arbitrary number of children to a binary tree?
  - left points to one of the children, right points to "siblings"

```c++
struct Node
{
  string data;
  Node* left;
  Node* right;
}

// eg. for a family tree
struct Node
{
  string data;
  Node* oldestChild;
  Node* nextYoungerSibling;
}
```

- _complete binary tree_ is a binary tree that is filled at every level
  - except possibly the bottom, which is filled left to right
  - only one configuration for every number of filled nodes

### Binary Search Tree

- special application of a binary tree
- either empty, or a node with a left BST and a right BST such that:
  - the value at every node in the left BST is <= the value at this node and
  - the value at every node in the right BST is >= the value at this node
- _traversals_ always O(N), visit every item
- _search_: O(logN), similar to binary search on a sorted array
  - worst case O(N)
- example _insert_ algorithm: (O(logN), search and then insert)
  - if empty, add as first node
  - otherwise, if less than current item, follow nodes to the left
  - otherwise, if greater than current item, follow nodes to the right
  - loop recursively
  - but this could lead to **unbalanced** sort trees with O(N) searching!
- example _removal_ algorithm: (O(logN), search and then insert)
  - must keep track of parent
  - if target is a leaf node:
    - _unlink_ from its parent (set parent to point to nullptr) and _delete_ it
  - if has one child:
    - _relink_ its parent to target's only child and _delete_ it
  - if has two children:
    - **replace** its values with: (don't actually _delete_ the node itself)
      - the largest value in its left subtree and _then delete_ that node
      - ie. one step to the left and all the way to the right
      - the smallest value in its right subtree and _then delete_ that node
      - ie. one step to the right and all the way to the left
  - thus, this utilizes a simpler deletion algorithm for the replacement
  - how do we choose which value to promote when deleting a node?
    - alternate left and right, or just randomly choose
- **balanced BST's**:
  - **AVL tree** - height of left subtree and right subtree differ by no more than one
    - _search_: always O(logN), always balanced
    - _insertion_: first insert using "dumb" algorithm and then rebalance the tree (O(logN), worse constant than "dumb" approach)
    - _deletion_: O(logN), worse constant than "dumb" approach
  - **2-3 Tree** - every node has two children (holds 1 value) or three children (holds 2 values)
    - all leaf nodes are at the same depth
    - _search_: don't have to go as deep
    - _insertion_: combination of splitting and promoting nodes
  - **Red-Black Tree** 2-3-4 trees - can represent structure using regular BST's
    - each node has extra boolean value defining its type / rules
    - no adjacent red nodes, every path from root to descendant has same number of black nodes
    - left and right subtrees differ up to a factor of 2
    - _less_ work for balancing, but good enough
    - _all operations_: O(logN), better constant for insert / deletion than AVL tree
    - used with STL containers, eg. set

```c++
struct Node
{
  string data;
  Node* left;
  Node* right;
}

// inorder traversal
void printTree(const Node* t)
{
  if (t == nullptr)
    return;
  printTree(t->left);  // print left subtree
  cout << t->data << endl;
  printTree(t->right); // print right subtree
}
```

## Hash Table

- we want to organize items indexed by ints, eg. 40,000 9-digit student IDs with student records
- if we had an array that is subscripted by the ID
  - lookup would be **constant** O(1), simply jump to the subscripted ID!
  - **BUT** wasted space in the array (1 billion slots in array, and what if the student record is large)
- now, have the array hold pointers instead of the actual student record
  - less space needed (only allocate 40,000 student records), but still empty slots in array
- now, organize the student ID's into various **buckets**
  - easy to determine what bucket student ID belongs to
  - can check even fewer elements in that bucket
    - buckets can be _empty_ or have different _number_ of items
  - eg. bucket number is last 4 digits of the student ID, 10,000 buckets with 4 elements each
- general _insert_ algorithm:
  - determine which bucket
  - add item into bucket
    - order of items in a bucket doesn't matter, so few items, just use the simplest insert operation
    - eg. front of a linked list
- this is a **hash table**!
- **collision** - two different keys map to the same bucket
- **load factor** = # of items / # of buckets
  - tradeoff between many empty buckets and a long list
  - as load factor increases, collision chance and search time increase
    - 0.7 load factor
- hash table with **fixed** number of buckets is actually O(N) but with a really low constant of proportionality
  - eg. for the student ID's, O(<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10000</sub>N)
  - slower as buckets become more full
  - for large enough N, BST still wins out!
- _compared to BST_:
  - hash table has a _start-up_ time
    - must initialize the buckets to nullptrs!
  - BST allows for easy sorted order _traversal_
    - possible solution with hash table:
      - every item in a bucket has a pointer to the next ordered item
      - probably doubly-linked
  - so, go with hash table **unless** we want to visit items in order
    - but if we don't have to visit sorted items often...
      - simply add all items from hash table into a vector, then sort the pointers / values
      - this is O(NlogN), worse than O(N) for BST traversal
      - but BST costs O(logN) for _every_ insert
    - paying O(logN) cost somewhere, hash table may be more efficient

## Dynamic / Resizable Hash Table

- _fixed_ limit on the load factor
- resize hash table and **reallocate** entire table with new buckets once limit is reached
  - eg. twice as many buckets
  - but now keys may be rehashed to different buckets (mod buckets gives a different value)
    - must be re-added
  - then add the new item
  - newly reallocated table has low load factor, then starts to fill up until max load faactor
- has constant time O(1), but every so often has to do a rehash O(N) when inserting
  - but **on average**, still O(1)! (_amortized_, averaged)
  - however, big rehashes can cause spikes of bad time complexity
- instead, use **incremental** rehashing:
  - rehash some of the table at one time instead of entire table (eg. 5 elements)
  - when new table is partially rehashed:
    - search, insertion, and deletion must check _both_ tables (still O(1))
      - every insertion / deletion will incrementally rehash more elements from the first table
  - but now, **every** insertion has a constant runtime!
    - ie. 20% of the time, in two-table mode, have a higher constant runtime

### Hash Functions

- **hash function** - key -> integer (then take integer and scale to number of buckets)
  - then, integer mod number of buckets to scale to buckets
  - eg. strings, add up the ACII codes; /1000 or %1000 for numbers
    - could also multiply ASCII codes
    - selecting digits, folding (adding digits), modulo arithmetic, string to int
  - use a prime number for number of buckets
    - eg. h(x) = x % numBuckets
    - reduces collisions
    - deals with distributions that aren't uniform
  - want cheap, deterministic, uniformly distributed result
- collision resolution schemes
  - _linear probing_ - **closed** hash - data stored in a fixed-size array
    - "closed" number of buckets
    - if bucket is occupied, scan down from bucket until we hit the first open bucket
      - buckets represented as arrays
      - if at end of buckets, wrap around to the front
      - when searching, now have to probe linearly until we find our value or hit empty bucket
    - issue of primary clustering (values are as close to intended bucket as possible)
      - longer probing sequences and time to seach
      - difficult to delete items, limit on # of items to hold!
      - deleting items may disrupt the linear probing
    - less efficient, faster growth in search time
    - more memory efficient
    - average number of checks for insert/find: $1/2(1+1/(1-L))$
  - _separate chaining_ - **open** hash tables - data stored in linked-lists, **not** size-limited
    - in case of collision, just add another value to the linked-list
    - more efficient, slower growth in search time
    - average number of checks for insert/find: $1 + L/2$
- sample hash function for strings:

```c++
// FNV-1 variation (Folwer-No-Vo) - fast while maintaining low collision with high dispersion
unsigned int h = 2166136261U; // ensure positive, U removes compiler warning for large integer
                              // "offset basis"
for (int k = 0; k < key.size(); k++)
{
  h += key[k];
  h *= 16777619; // FNV_prime, eg. 2^40 + 2^8 + 0xb3
}

// STL hash function
#include <functional>

unsigned int hashFunct(const std::string& key)
{
  std::hash<std::string> str_hash; // define string hashing object
  unsigned int hashValue = str_hash(key);
  return hashValue % NUM_BUCKETS;
}
```

## Heap

- **(max) heap** - a complete binary tree where each node has a value >= all the nodes in its subtrees
  - order and what's in each child isn't important...
- eg:

```c++
        90
    60      80
  40  50  70  20
10  30
```

- **min heap** - a complete binary tree where each node has a value less than or equal to all the nodes in its subtrees
- is a [complete binary tree](#binary-tree)
- _insertion_:
  - first add the item to make a complete binary tree (only one possible location)
  - then, if the item is greater than its parent, simply swap them
    - "**bubble**" up the new items to its proper position (reheapify)
    - O(logN) to bubble up
- _removal_: (only want to remove max item)
  - remove root
  - promote bottom-most item (of complete binary tree) and **promote** it to the root
    - ie. remake tree into a complete binary tree
  - "**trickle**" down the root to its proper position (reheapify)
    - at each level, make sure parent is larger than both its children
  - O(logN) to trickle down
- **[heap sort](#heap-sort) / partial heap sort**:
  - insert all items into a heap (O(NlogN)) and then extract however many items (OKlogN)
  - uses heaps to sort an array partially, eg. top N items
  - approximately O(NlogN)
- but in either case, have to calculate position of the bottom-right node / parent and children nodes in the tree
  - there is another representation that allows for this calculation to be done in constant time
    - use **arrays**!
- number nodes from left to right, top to bottom from 0 to N-1, and use that number as the index in an array
  - given node number i, is there a formula that generates the parent and children of i?
    - (i-1)/2 gives the parent of i (using integer division)
    - 2i+1 and 2i+2 gives the children of i, provided they are less than the number of nodes
  - now it is constant time to find the bottom-most item of the tree! (given at N-1)
  - can still use the same bubble up / trickle down algorithms (they still have the same complexity)
  - use array _operations_ but visualize with a tree!

## Tables

- made up of multiple _records_ (represented by a struct)
  - each record has related _fields_
- a table can be represented by a collection of structs
- how to efficiently search by different fields (eg. name, ID, phone number)?
  - retain one table, but:
  - use secondary data structures called _indexes_
    - eg. maps mapping name to slot in vector, id to slot in vector, etc.
  - when updating and deleting records, must update across all indexes
- use BST to store data in order
- use hash table for fast searching when order isn't important (eg. phone numbers)

## Graphs

- made up of **nodes** (vertices) and **edges** (arcs) connecting them
  - graphs can have _undirected_ or _directed_ edges
    - _cyclic_ graph where a path leads back to a node vs. _acyclic_ graph
    - directed, acyclic graphs are relatively common
- graphs can model many different types of problems
- there are many graph algorithms of different time complexities
  - "graph theory"
  - eg. _topological sort_
- _implementation_:
  - use a 2-d array if lots of edges between vertices but few vertices
  - each element indicates if there is an edge between vertex i & j
    - called an **adjacency matrix**
  - multiplying an adjacency matrix by itself yields a matrix showing us vertices 2, 3, etc. edges apart
  - could also use an array of lists if few edges and many vertices
    - eg. list<int> graph[n]
- breadth-first and depth-first traversals also apply to graphs
  - forward until dead end vs. exploring graph in growing concentric circles
- can have _weighted_ edges on graphs
  - use Dijktra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between any two nodes in a graph
    - uses settled / unsettled vertices

# Standard Template Library (STL)
***

- we've seen stacks and queues in the STL
- using STL requires _using namespace std_

## Vectors

- dynamically resizable array
- error checking **not** built into subscript operator, because it would be expensive!
  - to be safe, check if subscript is out of bounds
- at() function _does_ do bounds checking
- inserting in the middle is expensive
- jumping to different elements is cheap (via brackets)

```c++
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> vi;
vi.empty(); // true
vi.push_back(10);
vi.push_back(20);
vi.push_back(30);   // no push_front()
cout << vi.size();  // writes 3 (doesn't work for arrays!)
cout << vi.front(); // writes 10
cout << vi.back();  // writes 30
vi[1] = 40;         // gives a reference to that value, vi[3] = 50; would be undefined behavior
for (size_t k = 0; k < vi.size(); k++) // size_t, unsigned integer type
  cout << vi[k] << endl;
  // writes 10 40 30, one per line
vi.pop_back();      // undefined if vector is empty, vi.empty()
for (size_t k = 0; k < vi.size(); k++)
  cout << vi[k] << endl;
  // writes 10 40, one per line
vi.at(1) = 60;
vi.at(3) = 70;      // throws exception

vector<double> vd(10);          // vd.size() is 10, each element is 0.0
vector<string> vs(10, "Hello"); // vs.size() is 10, each element is "Hello"
int a[5] = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };
vector<int> vx(a, a+5);         // passing a range of values in a container
// vx.size() is 5, vx[0] is 10, vx[1] is 20, ..., vx[4] is 50

// optionally:
vector<int> vx = {10,20,30,40,50}; // C++11
vector<int> vx {10,20,30,40,50};   // C++11
vector<int> vx(100);               // all 100 elements are default initialized / constructed

// common mistake:
vector<int> vi;
// vi[0] = 10; // undefined! vi.size() is 0, no elements!
```

### Implementation

- _data members_:
  - dynamically allocated array
  - size
  - capacity
- empty:
  - nullptr to array
  - size, cap of 0
- at _full_ capacity:
  - allocates a larger capacity, copies values, deletes old values, retargets pointer, update capacity
- this means saving a pointer can leave a dangling pointer _later on_ after a pushback!
  - _anything pointing_ to the vector can become **invalidated**!
  - remember the position instead of saving a pointer...

## List

- linked list
  - similar functions as the vector class (push_back, pop_back, front, back, size, empty)
    - but _also_ has push_front and pop_front
- subscript and at() are **not** given with a list!
  - very expensive
- inserting / deleting in the middle is not as expensive
- jumping to elements is expensive

```c++
#include <list>
using namespace std;
list<int> li;
li.push_back(20);
li.push_back(30);
li.push_front(10);
cout << li.size();  // writes 3
cout << li.front(); // writes 10
cout << li.back();  // writes 30
li.push_front(40);
li.pop_front();     // also pop_back()
```

## Set

- _associative containers_:
  - designed so that searching for items is efficient
- eg. a set is a collection that **doesn't** allow duplicates
  - more efficient than searching in an unordered container
  - no [] operator!
    - but _can_ iterate over the container
      - guaranteed to iterate through set _in order_ using `<` operator
      - requirement for items in set to have `<` operator _defined_
      - set's definition of duplicate:
      - !(a `<` b) and !(a `<` c), then a == b
      - this definition only works well with total ordering (eg. not case-sensitive strings)
      - other containers use different operators for ordering
- set and multiset use a [Red-Black Tree](#binary-search-tree) (BST) for implementation
  - standard requires logarithmic time for all operations
  - multiset allows for duplicate values
- unordered_set / unordered_multiset use a [Hash Table](#hash-table) implementation
  - #include <unordered_set>
  - unordered_set.find(x)

```c++
#include <set> // defines std::set and std::multiset

set<int> s;
s.insert(10);
s.insert(30);
s.insert(20);
s.insert(10);
cout << s.size(); // writes 3
if (s.find(20) == s.end())
  ... not found ...
for (set<int>::iterator p = s.begin(); p != s.end(); p++)
  cout << *p << endl;
// guaranteed to write out 10 20 30
s.erase(10);
```

## Map

- another _associative container_
- maps one related value to another
  - eg. people to their phone number, ie. strings to ints
- maps can only associate in **one** direction!
  - to search efficiently in both directions, need _two_ maps
- **doesn't** allow duplicates
- map class stores each association in a **struct** variable:
  - eg. string first, int second
- use iterators to traverse through
  - can access first and second variables similar to a struct
- maps are automatically maintained in _alphabetical_ order for the key!
  - thus if associating a complex data type, operator `<` **must** be defined to order items
    - but only for the **left-hand** side of the map (key)
- map and multimap use a [Red-Black Tree](#binary-search-tree) (BST) for implementation
  - O(logN) for all operations
- multimap allows for duplicate keys
- unordered_map / unordered_multimap use a [Hash Table](#hash-table) implementation
  - requires `<`, == operator
  - a hash function for the type
    - provided for built-in type, strings, thread-ID's, etc.
    - have to write hash function for other custom types

```c++
#include <map> // defines std::map and std::multimap
using namespace std;

map<string, double> ious;
string name;
double amt;
while (cin >> name >> amt)
  ious[name] += amt; // overloaded subscript operator, can add new maps or update maps in this way

cout << ious.size() << " people owe me money" << endl;
for (map<string, double>::iterator p = ious.begin(); p != ious.end(); p++)
  cout << p->first << " owes me $" << p->second << endl;

map<string, int> name2Phone;       // string to int, but not the other way around!
name2Phone["Carey"] = 0001112222;
name2Phone["Joe"] = 2223334444;
// name2Phone[1112223333] = "Ed"; // doesn't compile

map<string, int>::iterator it;
it = name2Phone.find("Joe");      // locate an association
if (it == name2Phone.end())
  cout << "not found!" << endl;
else
{
  cout << it->first;              // look at the pair of values pointed to by iterator
  cout << it->second;
}

map<int, string> fones2Names;      // int to string

// dealing with duplicate keys:

// use a multimap...
// equal_range() returns a pair of iterators indicating the range of equal keys
multimap<string, double> borrowings;
pair<multimap<string, double>::iterator, multimap<string, double>::iterator> pr =
                                                borrowings.equal_range("fred");
if (pr.first == pr.second)
  ...not found...
else
  for (multimap<string, double>::iterator p = pr.first; p != pr.second; p++)
    cout << "fred borrowed $" << p->second << endl;

// alternatively, use a map with another STL container for more than one value
map<string, list<double>> borrowings;

// unordered_map as a hash table
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

unordered_map<string, double> ious;
```

### Auto Keyword

- how to _reduce_ verbeage when declaring iterators?
- declaration: sometype v = initializer;
- **auto** keyword sets variable type to the initializer automatically in a declaration
  - type is determined at compile time (NOT a varying type)

```c++
// pair<multimap<string,double>::iterator, multimap<string,double>::iterator> pr =  borrowings.equal_range("fred");
auto pr = borrowings.equal_range("fred"); // returns a pair, pr will be a variable of type pair, less redundant

// for (multimap<string,double>::iterator p = pr.first; p != pr.second; p++)
for (auto p = pr.first; p != pr.second; p++)

// map<string,int>::iterator p = ious.find("fred");
auto p = ious.find("fred");

auto* p = new Circle(...); // p is Circle*
auto* p = f(...);          // if f returns a Shape*, p is Shape*
```

## Iterators

- nodes and pointers in the list class are hidden from the user (they are abstracted away)
- instead provide something that acts like a pointer, called an **iterator**
  - no longer have to do messy pointer work
  - abstract way of traversing through elements
  - iterator is a class type, begin() and end() return iterators
- we can follow iterators with dereference operator, and use ++ and --
  - but can **not** use general pointer arithmetic, eg. adding 7 to an iterator
    - but you **can** with _VECTORS_! (cheaper!)
- using iterators, possible to:
  - _loop / traverse_ through a list
  - _insert_ a value (value is inserted just _before_ the passed iterator)
    - returns an iterator pointing to the inserted value
    - passed iterator remains the same (_unless_ used with a vector, then becomes **UNDEFINED** to use!)
      - when inserting a value into a vector, the vector may have been **RESIZED** and **REALLOCATED**!
      - when reallocation occurs, **all** iterators become invalidated!
      - but when begin() and end() are _recalled_ they return a valid iterator
  - _erase_ a value (erase value passed iterator is pointing to)
    - returns an iterator pointing to the value after the erased value
    - the passed iterator becomes **UNDEFINED** to use!
- iterators _can't_ hold a value of nullptr!
- sometimes need to use a const iterator (when a container is passed as const reference)
- notes on lists: (doubly-linked list)
  - _cannot_ use [] operator
  - _cannot_ use comparison operators with iterators (`>, <, <=, >=`), there is no valid ordering
  - using iterator to traverse a list is always safe
- notes on vectors: (dynamic array)
  - _can_ use [] to access elements in a vector
  - comparison operators are _valid_
  - but could **invalidate** iterators when using push_back()

```c++
structure<data type>::iterator it       // a pointer to an element in a container
structure<data type>::const_iterator it // constant iterator for constant reference
li.begin(); // an iterator pointing to beginning of the list
li.end();   // an iterator pointing to just after last value of the list
            // can't follow the iterator here, must decrement first!
li.back();  // an iterator pointing to the last element of the list

// can use these iterators to initialize a vector
list<double> ld(10);                     // ld.size() is 10, each element is 0.0
list<string> ls(10, "Hello");            // ls.size() is 10, each element is "Hello"
vector<string> vs(ls.begin(), ls.end()); // vs.size() is 10, vs[0] is "Hello", vs[1] is "Hello", ..., vs[9] is "Hello"

// Iterators with Lists:

for (list<int>::iterator p = li.begin(); p != li.end(); p++)
  cout << *p << endl;  // writes 10 20 30, one per line
// can also use rbegin() and rend() for reverse traversal (still would increment to advance the iterator)
// can also use constant iterators to promise not to change the list

list<int>::iterator p = li.end();
p--;
p--; // given a list with {10, 20, 30}, p points to 20
// p -= 2 won't compile

list<int>::iterator q = li.insert(p, 40); // insert() inserts value just before the iterator
// list is now {10, 40, 20, 30}
// q points to 40 (the inserted value), p still points to 20

list<int>::iterator q = li.erase(p);      // erase() erases value iterator points to
// list is now {10, 40, 30}
// q points to 30 (value after erased value), now UNDEFINED to use p!

for (list<int>::iterator p = l.begin(); p != l.end();)
  if (*p == 30)
    p = l.erase(p); // remove value pointed by p, and reassign the return value back to it (no need to increment)
  else
    p++;

// Iterators with Vectors:

vector<int>::iterator p = vi.end() – 2;
// given a vector with {10, 20, 30}, p points to 20

vector<int>::iterator q = vi.insert(p, 40); // insert() inserts value just before the iterator
// vector is now {10, 40, 20, 30}
// q points to 40 (the inserted value), now UNDEFINED to use p! (vector could have been RESIZED and values REALLOCATED!)

p = vi.erase(q);                            // erase() erases value iterator points to
// vector is now {10, 20, 30}
// p points to 20 (value after erased value), now UNDEFINED to use q!
```

### Iterators with Templates

A find function:

```c++
// b points to beginning, e points to just after the end
int* find(int* b, int* e, const int& target)
{
  for ( ; b != e; b++)
    if (*b == target)
      break;
  return b; // going to be generalized later for iterators, can't return nullptr
}           // we return just past the end value if target not found

// Template Version:
template<typename T>
T* find(T* b, T* e, const T& target)
{
  for ( ; b != e; b++)
    if (*b == target) // T must have an equality comparison operator
      break;          // but this WOULDN'T work when called with "Fred" (a pointer to a char array!)
  return b;           // we want to decouple the target type from the traversing type (to use with pointers / iterators)
}
string* sp = find(sa, sa+4, string(“Fred”)); // would need a temporary string object to use correct equality comparison

// Template Version w/ Iterators:
template<typename Iter, typename T>
Iter find(Iter b, Iter e, const T& target)
{
  for ( ; b != e; b++)
    if (*b == target) // CAN compare string (*b) to a char pointer!
      break;
  return b;
}

int* p = find(a, a+5, k);
if (p == a+5)
  ... not found ...

list<string>::iterator q = find(ls.begin(), ls.end(), "Fred");
if (q == ls.end())
  ... not found ...

vector<int>::iterator r = find(vi.begin(), vi.begin()+5, 42);
if (r == vi.begin()+5)
  ... not found ...
```

## STL Algorithms

- #include <algorithm>
- find(v.begin(), v.end(), val)
  - also works with arrays: find(&a[0], &a[5], 19)
- reverse(v.begin(), v.end())
- sort(v.begin(), v. end()) (uses quick sort, not supported with list, needs random access)
  - list has its _own_ sort member function (special case, uses merge sort)
- set_intersection() - compute intersection of two sorted collections of data
- can pass a **predicate function** with many of these functions:
  - calls that predicate function on each of the elements!

```c++
template<typename Iter, typename Func>
Iter find_if(Iter b, Iter e, Func f)
{
  for ( ; b != e; b++)
    if (f(*b)) break; return b;
}

bool isNegative(int k) { return k < 0; }
bool isEmpty(string s) { return s.empty(); }

int main()
{
  vector<int> vi;
  vector<int>::iterator p = find_if(vi.begin(), vi.end(), isNegative);
  if (p == vi.end())
    ... not found ...
  list<string> ls;
  list<string>::iterator q = find_if(ls.begin(), ls.end(), isEmpty);
}

bool isGreater(int i, int j) { return i > j; }
bool makesLessThan(const Employee& e1, const Employee& e2) { return e1.salary() < e2.salary(); }
bool hasBetterRecord(const Team& t1, const Team& t2)
{
  if (t1.wins() > t2.wins())
    return true;
  if (t1.wins() < t2.wins())
    return false; return
  t1.ties() > t2.ties();
}

int main()
{
  vector<int> vi;
  sort(vi.begin(), vi.end()); // uses <
  sort(vi.begin(), vi.end(), isGreater);
  Employee ea[100];
  sort(ea, ea+100, makesLessThan);
  vector<Team> league;
  sort(league.begin(), league.end(), hasBetterRecord);

  list<int> li;
  li.sort(); // uses <
  list<Employee> le;
  le.sort(makesLessThan);
}

// pointers to functions:
int (*ptr) (int); // ptr points to any function that returns an int and takes a single int
ptr = squared;
cout << ptr(5);
```

# Recursion
***

- to solve larger problems, _break down_ into smaller problems
  - but there needs to be one or more _base cases_ (stopping condition)
    - ie. situations that can be solved without a recursive call
      - proof of termination
  - _recursive cases_ - must solve a smaller problem, closer to a base case (simplifying step)
    - usually:
      1. divide input problem in **half** (merge sort)
      2. operate on input that is _one smaller_
      3. eg. back to front (last and the rest), front to back (first and the rest), divide and conquer
- eg. to **sort** an unsorted pile of N items
  - if (N > 1)
    - split into two unsorted piles of N/2 items
    - sort left subpiles
    - sort right subpiles
    - **merge** two resulting sorted subpiles into one sorted pile
  - base cases: N is 1 or 0
- some issues
  - odd N? merge algorithm still works
  - down to one item?
    - would **continue** trying to sort/split a single item
    - **infinite** recursion!
- some steps:
  1. write function header
  - find out what / num of arguments, return type
  2. define "**magic**" function
  - solves problem, but only with a smaller subset / n
  - **same** parameters and return type!
  3. add base case code
  - deal with **simplest** possible inputs
  4. solve problem w/ magic function (_recursive leap of faith_)
  5. remove magic...
  6. validate function
  - test with simplest possible inputs
  - test with incrementally more complex inputs
- recursion **vs.** iterative solutions?
  - for simple recursion (one recursive call), easily implementable with iteration
    - iterative solution is usually _faster_
  - for more than one recursive calls, _simpler_ to write and implement
    - divide and conquer recursion
- recursion can be **expensive**! (lots of local variables)
  - **DON'T** use recursion when it isn't neccesary!
  - don't let recursive calls get too deep
- can use _recursive helper functions_ to simplify complex parameters
  - eg. binary search's confusing bot / top parameters

## Recursion Examples

### Sorting Algorithm

- **indexing**: a subarray starts at b and goes to one item before end

```c++
void sort(int a[], int b, int e)
{
  if (e - b > 1) // more than one element
  {
    int mid = (b + e) / 2;
    sort(a, b, mid);
    sort(a, mid, e);
    merge(a, b, m, e);
  }
}
```

### Finding a Target

```c++
bool contains(int a[], int n, int target)
{
  if (n <= 0)
    return false;
  if (a[0] == target)
    return true;
  return contains(a+1, n-1, contains); // pointer airthmetic, start at second element of array
}
// Order matters!
bool contains(int a[], int n, int target)
{
  if (n <= 0)
    return false;
  if (contains(a+1, n-1, target)) // calls n recursive calls even if early element is already target
    return true;
  return a[0] == target;
}
// Back to front!
bool contains(int a[], int n, int target)
{
  if (n <= 0)
    return false;
  if (a[n-1] == target)
    return true;
  return contains(a, n-1, contains);
}
```

- some initial issues:
  - never return false
  - have to check subscript / pointer arithmetic is valid
  - so, return false if n `<=` 0
- optimize to reduce recursive calls
- front to back vs. back to front approach

### Solving a Maze

```c++
bool solve(start, goal)
{
  if (start == goal) // if we're at the goal
    return true
  mark this position as visited // check where we've been
  for each direction
    if moving one step is possible and not been visited,
      if (solve(pos reached by that move), goal)
        return true
  return false
}
```

- some initial issues:
  - don't check where we've been
  - starting at the goal
- is recursion solving a simpler problem?
  - distance not necessarily shorter, because of _walls_
  - mark where we have visited, reducing unvisited places

# Big-O
***

- how do we categorize the speed of an algorithm?
  - can't just compare runtimes
    - must account for hardware differences
  - count steps in the algorithm in terms of N
    - any basic operation is a step
    - but we don't really care for speed with a small N
    - or about the exact details
  - so we can disregard the lower-order terms
    - can also generalize and disregard the leading coefficient
      - finding the worst case scenario
- a function $f(N)$ is $O(g(N))$, if there exists $N_0$ and $k$ s.t. for all $N >= N_0$, $f(N) `<=` k*g(N)$
- f(N) is "order g(N)"

## Operations with Arrays

- O(1) - accessing elements in an array (_constant time_)
- O(logN) - binary searching elements in an array (_logarithmic time_)
  - always dividing in half, log~2~N gives number of comparisons
    - can disregard base 2, all logarithms are proportional
  - grows very slowly over constant time
- O(N) - searching elements in an array (_linear time_)
- O(NlogN) - grows very slowly over linear time (_linear logarithmic time_)
- O(2^N^) - printing all possible subsets in a collection
  - one more item doubles the time

## More Examples

### Process for Evaulating Big-O

- work _inside-out_, starting from the most deeply nested statement
- have to account for _hidden_ loops
  - eg. loops in embedded functions

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
  c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
// basic operations all take a constant amount of time
// array subscript operator is simply multiplication and addition
// every loop takes constant time, runs N times, this algorithm is O(N)

for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)   // entire algorithm is O(N^2)
{                             // body of loop is O(N)
  a[i] *= 2;                  // O(1)
  for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) // happens N times, O(N)
    d[i][j] = a[i] * b[j];    // array subscripts are O(1)
}
// work inside out, from most deeply nested statement
// shouldn't assume every loop in a loop is O(N^2)...
// if inner loop only ran up to 100, algorithm would be O(N)
// little trivial differences, eg. starting at 1 or going to N-1,  aren't important

for (int i = 0; i < N; i++ )     // entire algorithm is O(N^2)
{                                // body of loop is O(N)
  if (find(a, a+N, 10*i) != a+N) // find() is O(N), comparison is O(1)
    count++;                     // O(1)
}
// not just O(N) simply because there is one loop! (find() itself is O(N)!)
// have to count the hidden for loops!
// how do we account for if statements?
// for worst case scenario, assume body of if will always execute

for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)   // O(N^2)
{                             // O(i) + O(1) = O(i)
  a[i] *= 2;                  // O(1)
  for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) // O(i)
    d[i][j] = a[i] * b[j];    // O(1)
}
// sum of all numbers from 1 to N-1 is 1/2 N^2 - 1/2 N
// still O(N^2)! (ignore constant proportionality, for now)

for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)   // O(N^2logN)
{                             // O(NlogN)
  a[i] *= 2;                  // O(1)
  for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) // O(NlogN)
    d[i][j] = f(a, N);        // O(logN)
}`
// given f() is O(logN)

// example with STL set
void addItems(set<int> &s, int q)
{
  for (int i = 0; i < q*q; i++)   // O(Q^2logQ^2)
    s.insert(i);                  // O(logN) to insert
}                                 // in worse case, N will eventually become Q^2
```

### Multiple Variables

- what if the Big-O depends on multiple parameters / variables?
  - have to keep track of both parameters!
    - either variable could dominate the other

```c++
for (...R times...)   // O(RClogC)
  for (...C times...) // O(ClogC)
    f(...c)           // O(logC)
```

# Sorting Algorithms
***

General rules:

1. don't choose a sort until you know the requirements of the problem
2. always choose the simplest sorting algorithm possible that meets your needs

**stable sort**:

- takes into account initial ordering when sorting
- maintains the order of similar-values items

**unstable sort**:

- re-orders items without taking into account their initial ordering

## Selection Sort

- loop through unchecked indices, find **minimum** and swap
  - even if no swap is necessary (ie. minimum at current index)
    - this algorithm would still check the rest of the items
- no best or worse case, _always_ O(N^2^)
- learning nothing on each pass
  - only useful when swapping/movements is really _expensive_ compared to comparisons
- example sort:

```c++
|5 3  7  6  1  8  2  4
1 |3  7  6  5  8  2  4
1  2 |7  6  5  8  3  4
1  2  3 |6  5  8  7  4
1  2  3  4 |5  8  7  6
1  2  3  4  5 |6  7  8
1  2  3  4  5  6 |7  8
1  2  3  4  5  6  7 |8
```

- Implementation:

```c++
void selectionSort(int A[], int n)
{
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
  {
    int minIndex = i;
    for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++)
    {
      if (A[j] < A[minIndex])
        minIndex = j;
    }
    swap(A[i], A[minIndex]);
  }
}
```

## Bubble Sort

- check **pairs** of items, put them in sorted order
- after one loop, the largest item is _guaranteed_ to be shifted to the last item
- loop again, stopping right before that largest item
  - we can skip steps by setting the stopping position at the last swap
- _best case_: O(N) - already sorted
- _worst case_: O(N^2^) - reverse order, swapping all the time
- _average case_: still O(N^2^) - but constant of proportionality is _half_ as bad
- example sort:

```c++
5  3  7  6  1  8  2  4|
3  5  6  1  7  2  4| 8 # 8 is largest item
3  5  1  6  2  4| 7  8
3  1  5  2  4| 6  7  8
1  3  2  4| 5  6  7  8
1  2| 3  4  5  6  7  8 # put stopping position at last swap
|1 2  3  4  5  6  7  8 # if no swaps, array is sorted
```

- Implementation:

```c++
void bubbleSort(int Arr[], int n)
{
  bool atLeastOneSwap;
  do
  {
    atLeastOneSwap = false;
    for (int j = 0; j < (n-1); j++)
    {
      if (Arr[j] > Arr[j + 1])
      {
        swap(Arr[j],Arr[j+1]);
        atLeastOneSwap = true;
      }
    }
  }
  while (atLeastOneSwap == true);
}
```

## Shell Sort

- built on underlying sort called _h-sorting_
  - pick a value for h
  - for every element in the array:
    - if a[i] and a[i+h] are out of order, swap them
  - if any elements were swapped in the last pass, repeat again with same h
  - eg. when an element is 3-sorted, every element is smaller than the element 3 items later
  - 1-sorting _is_ a bubble sort
- _shell sort_ approach:
  - select a sequence of decreasing h-values **ending** with 1
    - eg. 8, 4, 2, 1
  - then 8-sort, 4-sort, 2-sort, finally 1-sort the array
- ~O(N^1.25^) depending on the decrement sequence!
  - does not require much extra storage

## Insertion Sort

- similar to ordering a hand of cards as they are dealt
  - insert cards picked up in order into the hand
    - examine cards in hand one by one to figure out where to put the next card
  - hand is always **in order**
- _best case_: O(N) - already sorted
- _worst case_: O(N^2^) - reverse order, have to compare with all previous items
- _average case_: O(N^2^) - but constant of proportionality is _half_ as bad as previous algorithms
- _slightly_ better than bubble sort
- **except** if all itmes are _no more_ than some **constant** distance out of place, only shifting constant times, then insertion sort is O(N)!
- example sort:

```c++
5 |3  7  6  1  8  2  4
3  5 |7  6  1  8  2  4
3  5  7 |6  1  8  2  4 # got lucky, only one comparison
3  5  6  7 |1  8  2  4
1  3  5  6  7 |8  2  4 # lots of comparisons and shifting
1  2  3  5  6  7  8 |4
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8|
```

- Implementation:

```c++
void insertionSort(int A[], int n)
{
  for(int s = 2; s <= n; s++)
  {
    int sortMe = A[ s - 1 ];
    int i = s - 2;
    while (i >= 0 && sortMe < A[i])
    {
      A[i+1] = A[i];
      --i;
    }
    A[i+1] = sortMe;
  }
}
```

## Merge Sort

- **merging** two sorted piles is O(N)
- but what is the runtime for a recursive algorithm?
- $T(N) = 2T(N/2) + O(N)$ (_recurrence relation_) ~ O(NlogN) (_all cases_)
  - much better runtime than O(N^2^)
    - **except** if all itmes are _no more_ than some constant items out of place
      - may take longer than insertion sort
- doesn't require _random access_ (fine with arrays, vectors, lists)
  - list's sort member function uses merge sort
    - lists are easy to swap / copy items, so could be _faster_ than quick sort if expensive to move items
- because merge function needs secondary arrays to merge, this can slow things down compared to quicksort
- requires extra storage (O(N)) to have a good constant of proportionality
- Merge() Implementation:

```c++
void merge(int data[],int n1, int n2)
{
  int i=0, j=0, k=0;
  int* temp = new int[n1+n2]; // needs a temporary array!
  int* sechalf = data + n1;

  while (i < n1 || j < n2)
  {
    if (i == n1)
      temp[k++] = sechalf[j++];
    else if (j == n2)
      temp[k++] = data[i++];
    else if (data[i] <= sechalf[j])
      temp[k++] = data[i++];
    else
      temp[k++] = sechalf[j++];
  }
  for (i=0;i<n1+n2;i++)
    data[i] = temp[i];
  delete [] temp;
}
```

## Quick Sort

- **partition** array around a pivot/divider (O(N))
  - pivot should evenly divide array, but hard to find median (merge sort would be faster at this point)
    - so choose first value or a random pivot
    - recursively sort each half
  - similar relationship to merge sort: pick a pivot (constant run time), recursively sort
  - other possible _improvements_ (Sedgewick):
  1. find **median** of a small sample for the pivot, eg. first 3 items
     - but this is bad if array is already sorted
     - instead, median of 3 (first, middle, last)
       - 3 is the best compared to 5, 7, etc. values
       - not necessarily first, middle, last (vulnerable to forcing an O(N^2^)), can be random
  2. have quick sort abandon sub-arrays of size 9 or fewer
     - but the various pivots are still in their right place!
     - then call **insertion sort** / **heap sort** across the entire array!
     - items are no more than constant distance (9) out of place, so O(N) for insertion sort!
     - 9 is the sweet spot
  3. STL uses a _variation_ on quick sort called **introsort**:
     - deep recursion happens if there are bad pivot choices
     - when depth exceeds some limit (2logN)
       - sort stops using quick sort for this _sub-region_, instead uses **heap sort**
     - completely avoid O(N^2^) runtime!
     - _always_ O(NlogN)
- _best case_: O(NlogN)
- _average case_: O(NlogN) - depends on the split, but _better_ constant of proportionality than merge sort
- _worst case_: O(N^2^) - every pivot is the worst possible pivot, least or biggest value (mostly sorted or reverse order)
  - $T(N) = O(N) + T(N-1)$ ~ O(N^2^)
- good sort to use if occasional O(N^2^) is acceptable
  - but requires _random access_ (so only for arrays/vectors, **not** lists)!
    - picking pivot requires _random access_
- example sort:

```c++
[5]3  7  6  1  8  2  4 # partition array around first pivot
      4  2        6  7 # swap elements that are on wrong side from either end
1  3  4  2  [5]8  6  7 # put pivot in corresponding spot when the ends meet
[1]3  4  2             # sort left half
1  [3]2  4             # one item is a base case, sort right sub-half
1  2  [3]4
               [8]6  7 # sort right half
               7  6 [8]
               6  7    # two items is another base case
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
```

- Implementation:

```c++
void QuickSort(int Array[], int First, int Last)
{
  if (Last – First >= 1 )
  {
    int PivotIndex;
    PivotIndex = Partition(Array,First,Last);
    QuickSort(Array,First,PivotIndex-1); // left
    QuickSort(Array,PivotIndex+1,Last);  // right
  }
}

int Partition(int a[], int low, int high)
{
  int pi = low;
  int pivot = a[low];
  do
  {
    while ( low <= high && a[low] <= pivot )
      low++;
    while ( a[high] > pivot )
      high--;
    if ( low < high )
      swap(a[low], a[high]);
  }
  while ( low < high );
  swap(a[pi], a[high]);
  pi = high;
  return(pi);
}
```

## Heap Sort

- using **[heaps](#heap)**
- approach: we can sort by inserting all the items into a **maxheap**, and then extracting them one by one
- instead, build the maxheap _in place_...

1. **interpret** unsorted array into a complete binary tree (in array notation, not neccesarily a maxheap right now)
   - starting from the bottom right item, make a heap out of the current subtree by _trickling_ down
   - then work upwards through tree / _backwards_ in the array
   - but bottom most leaf nodes are already heaps of their own (only one item)
     - so we can start the recursion at N/2 - 1 (in the array)
   - want to sort in ascending order, but we made a _maxheap_?
2. **remove** each item:
   - swap position 0 of array with N-1, reduce N by 1, use same trickle down approach as extracting an item
     - just like when extracting from a maxheap, but swapping an item instead of deleting
   - when down to two items, just swap in order

- O(NlogN), not as good constant of proportionality as quick sort
- use this if we only need a certain number of items in order (can stop heap sort early)

## Stability of Sorts

- a **stable** sort maintains items that have equal value in the original order they were in
  - only O(NlogN) sort that guarantees this is **[merge sort](#merge-sort)**

// Rectangle* ra[100];
Shape* pic[100];     // can hold Circles AND Rectangles
pic[0] = new Circle; // how do we tell compiler Circle is a type of shape? (in declaration)
                     // converts Circle pointer to a Shape pointer
                     // pic really does contain pointers to shapes
pic[1] = new Rectangle;
pic[2] = new Circle;

for (int k = 0; k < ...; k++)
  pic[k]->draw();   // assumes all shapes have a draw() function
// for( int k = 0; k < ...; k++)
//   ca[k]->draw();
// for( int k = 0; k < ...; k++)
//   ra[k]->draw();

void f(Shape* x)    // for any shape now
{                   // converts Circle reference to Shape reference
  x->move(...,...); // move() works with all shapes
  x->draw();        // but draw() is different for every type of Shape!
}
// void f(Circle* x)
// {
//   x->move(...,...);
//   x->draw();
// }
// void f(Rectangle* x)
// {
//   x->move(...,...);
//   x->draw();
// }

double Rectangle::diag() const
{
  return sqrt(m_dx*m_dx + m_dy*m_dy);
}
double Square::diag() const // a reason to override a virtual function:
{                           // a more efficient implementtation
  return m_dx * sqrt(2);
}
```

- lots of **repetition**, some of these functions should work for every shape
  - our move() function will take the same parameters for _all shapes_, just absolute x and y coordinates
  - have to use multiple arrays and functions:
    - array for **each** shape type, needs a _family of functions_ for different shapes
  - error prone to add a new shape!
- how to reduce repetition and make it easier to add new objects / classes?
  - find a **generalization**!
  - circles and rectangles are all shapes
  - need approach that _works for all shapes_

## Inheritance

- this is **inheritance**!
  - **goals** of inheritance:
    - **reuse**:
      - every public function from base class is automatically reused in derived class
      - **not** private members, however!
    - **extension**:
      - _adding new_ functions or data to a derived class
      - however, unknown to the base class!
    - **specialization**:
      - **override** existing functions from base using the virtual keyword in declaration
      - can still call base function using :: operator
  - _general steps_ for inheritance:
    - figure out what to **represent** (bunch of shapes)
    - define base class with functions _common to all_ derived classes (area(), draw())
    - write derived classes with **specialized** versions of each common function
    - using **polymorphism**, we can access derived variables with base ptr / reference
    - remember to define virtual destructor in base class
- generalization: Circles and Rectangles are a **subclass** of Shape
  - in c++, they are both _derived classes_ of Shape
- Shape is a **superclass**
  - in c++, Shape is a _base class_
- a derived class pointer is _automatically converted_ to a base class pointer (_upcast_ is automatic)
  - Derived* => Base* (pointer to base within the specific derived class)
  - Derived& => Base& (same for references)
  - Derived => Base (c++ allows this, ie. _slicing_)
    - eg. Shape s(C); s = c;
    - converts to the base object **within** the derived object
    - **BUT** we lose the derived object
    - preferable to use pointers or references
  - **NO** automatic conversion from Base* => Derived*
    - _downcast_, have to use static_cast<SomeDerivedClass\*>
    - must be sure our conversion is meaningful:
      - undefined behavior if base ptr doesn't actually point to a derived object of that type
- can't have **contrary** relationship where two classes can't be derived from _each other_!

### Inheritance in Memory

- how can compiler access data members in a base class then?
  - every derived object has an **embedded** base object within it
  - compiler calculates the **layout** of the derived objects in memory
  - this is how the _automatic conversion works_ between base and derived classses
  - **note**: _can't access_ a derived class's members given a pointer to its base class

## Functions within Base and Derived Classes

- how to make sure every shape can be drawn and moved?
  - add to **declaration** of Shape
  - but the **implementation** for some functions are _different for each type_ of shape...
  - draw() might be different, but move() would act the same for different types
    - don't have to repeat the implementation of move() for every type of shape!
      - just implement move() **IN** shape, and remove declaration of move() from the derived classes
      - the derived classes **inherit** the move() function from Shape!
    - we can do the same for the data members that are the _same for all shapes_
  - just have to implement what makes derived classes **different** from their base classes
    - eliminates _duplication of code_!

## Virtual Functions

- what about for **draw**()?
  - different implementation for every shape...
  - but _still needs to be declared within_ Shape, so that f() would compile!
    - must guarantee _all shapes have_ a draw()
  - for now, we need a **generic** draw() for just a Shape
  - how do we call the derived class's specific draw() functions?
    - tell compiler to make the decision at runtime **NOT** compile-time (would call generic draw())
      - _static binding_: compile-time binding, call **generic** function no matter what (cheaper!)
      - _dynamic binding_: runtime binding, call **appropriate** function depending on object
  - different binding options for different languages
  - **usually**: dynamic by default, have to indicate static
  - **c++**: static by default, have to indicate dynamic (keyword **virtual** in **declaration**)
    - optional to repeat virtual in all the implementations of derived classes' functions
- _virtual functions_ allow base class functionality to be redefined in derived classes
  - can still access base class functions using base:: prefix
    - eg. Person::talks()

### Overriding Functions

```c++
class WarningSymbol : public Shape
{
  void move(double xnew, double ynew);
  ...
}

void WarningSymbol::move(double xnew, double ynew)
{
  // move(xnew, ynew); // won't work, recursive call
  // this->Shape::move(xnew, ynew);
  Shape::move(xnew, ynew);
  ... move like a Shape
  ... flash 3 times
}

WarningSymbol ws(...);
ws.move(...);  // warning symbol DOES flash! compiler calls the immediate move()
f(ws);         // warning symbol does NOT flash! calls Shape's move() function!
Shape* sp = &ws;
sp->move(...); // warning symbol does NOT flash!

void f(Shape& x)
{
  x.move(...);
}
```

- what if we then have a new Shape that **doesn't** move like all the other shapes?
  - eg. warning symbol that flashes 3 times
  - let's write a new move() that calls Shape's move()
- if we write a new move() function:
  - works correctly when called as a WarningSymbol object
  - but when called after being **converted** to a Shape, _will not flash_!
- **redefining** base class move as virtual **would** fix the problem
  - **BUT** could be expensive to redefine a large program like this
- in our example case, let's redefine move() as virtual

### Virtual Functions Demystified

```c++
Shape sp;
if (...)
  sp = new Rectangle(...)
else ...    // sp is some other shape

sp->draw();    // how does compiler know which draw() to call?
               // effectively: call function sp->vptr[1] points to
// sp->diag(); // remember, we can't do this, can only call Shape functions with a Shape ptr...
```

- **polymorphism** refers to the same function call leading to multiple actions
  - eg. when using a base pointer or a base reference to access a derived object
- compiler makes a table holding virtual functions (ie. _virtual table_, vtbl)
  - **Shape**'s vtbl holds move() and draw()
    - the position of these functions in vtbl is the **same** for all derived classes
  - **Rectangle**'s vtbl holds move(), draw(), and diag()
    - the move() _points to Shape's_ move() since Rectangle doesn't override it
- but how do we know which slot in vtbl to go to?
  - the compiler adds an _extra data member_ whenever classes have a virtual function
    - _virtual pointer_, vptr, that points to vtbl!
    - all constructors also **initialize** the vptr to point to the correct vtbl
- this implementation of virtual functions _doesn't require recompilation_ when more Shape types are added

### Pure Virtual Functions

```c++
class Shape
{
  virtual void move(double xnew, double ynew);
  // virtual void draw() const;  // still necessary to declare here!
  virtual void draw() const = 0; // no longer need generic draw() implementation!
                                 // a pure virtual function (Shape now an abstract class)
  double m_x;
  double m_y;
};
// void Shape::draw() const
// {                        // for now, we have to implement this generic draw() function
//   ... draw a cloud ...
// }
```

- how do we _get rid_ of the implementation of this generic, unecessary draw() function?
  - ie. avoid writing "dummy" logic
- use _pure virtual_ function that points to null in the vtbl
  - no longer providing an implementation that is automatically inherited
- what happens if we call draw() with a Shape that **isn't** part of a derived object?
  - now, it is a _compilation error_ to create a Shape!
- if a class contains _at least one_ pure virtual function:
  - this is now an _abstract class_ / _abstract base class_ (ABC)
    - **NOT** allowed to create objects of that class type!
    - not an issue:
      - many other abstractions eg. shape, mammal, many base classes
  - however, can still have references / pointers to a Shape!
    - can also still _construct_ abstract class within another!
- _derived classes_ can also be abstract
  - eg. ClosedFigure inheriting from Shape with pure virtual function fillColor()
  - ClosedFigure will inherit the pure virtual function draw() from Shape!
- _failing to declare_ pure virtual function in a derived class means it would also be abstract
- ABC's also **force** user to implement certain functions to prevent bugs

## Construction

```c++
class Shape
{
 public:
  Shape(double x, double y);
 private:
  double m_x;
  double m_y;
};
Shape::Shape(double x, double y)
  : m_x(x), m_y(y)
{}

class Circle : public Shape
{
 public:
  Circle(double x, double y, double r);
 private:
  double m_r;
};
Circle::Circle(double x, double y, double r)
// : m_x(x), m_y(y), m_r(r) // wrong! trying to access private members of Shape
  : Shape(x, y), m_r(r)
{}
```

- steps of construction:
  1. construct the base object (no matter where its listed)
  2. construct each data member, consulting the _member initialization list_
  - if not listed:
    - built-in type: left uninitialized
    - class type: default-constructed (having no default constructor is an **error**)
  3. execute _body of constructor_
- steps of destruction:
  1. execute body of destructor
  2. destroy data members / objects
  3. destroy the base object

## Destruction

```c++
class Shape
{
 public:
  ...
  virtual void draw() = 0;
  // virtual ~Shape() = 0; // should be virtual
  virtual ~Shape();
}

Shape::~Shape()
{}

class Polygon : public Shape
{
 public:
  ...
  virtual ~Polygon();
 private:
  ...
  Node* head; // collection of coordinates
}
****
Shape *sp;
if (...)
  sp = new Circle(...);
else
  sp = new Polygon(...);
delete sp; // calls Shape's destructor! leads to memory leak
```

- base class's destructor must be declared virtual to call the correct destructor!
- compiler error that there is _no implementation_ for the base object destructor
  - **can't** be a pure virtual function:
    - destructor for all derived classes **call** this destructor
  - but since we declared it, destructor is _no longer_ compiler generated
- _in general_: if a class is designed as a base class, declare its destructor as virtual and implement

# Function and Class Templates
***

## Function Templates

- _multiple_ functions for the _same_ operations with _different_ types
  - we can overload these functions
  - eg. minimum(int a, int b), minimum(double a, double b)
    - same algorithm for finding the minimum...
    - but _different machine language_ for comparing ints vs. doubles (different byte sizes)
    - but source code is **identical**!
- instead, can we tell compiler the **pattern** for the algorithm?
  - pattern for manufacturing a function
  - use **template** syntax in c++
- multiple templatized function calls of the same type call same function for that type
- can also have multi-type templates
- _steps for templates_:
  - match some template function (doesn't consider conversions)
    - "_template argument deduction_"
      - have to match the type _exactly_, except for matching to const in template (simple conversion)
    - at least one formal parameter must be defined by the template
  - instantiated template must compile
  - compiled code must function properly
    - eg. comparing c-strings with `<` only compares the pointers, undesired result
      - instead would need another minimum() using strcmp(a, b)
- non-template functions _takes precedence_ over a template function
  - specific case over general case
- should pass by _constant reference_ instead of value to deal with expensive types!
  - because it's possible to take any type in the template
- template functions **must** be declared and implemented in header files!
  - use #include to use the templated functions

```c++
template<typename T> // typename and class are interchangeable (besides convention)
T minimum(const T& a, const T& b) // more efficient to pass by const reference
{
  if (a < b)
    return a;
  else
    return b;
}
template<typename T1, typename T2>
?? minimum(T1 a, T2 b) // would work if called with int double, double int, int int, etc.
{
  if (a < b)
    return a;
  else
    return b;
}

int k = 3;
double x = 3.0;
minimum(k, 3);    // compiler manufactures code for minimum() with ints
minimum(x, 3.14); // same for doubles
minimum(k, x);    // no matching function template! doesn't consider conversions!
                  // now would match second template function (multi-type)
                  // but could return an int instead of a double depending on order of parameters
                  // this is impractical...
Chicken c1, c2;
// minimum(c1, c2); // comparison operator not overloaded for chickens!
```

### Useful Construction Syntax

```c++
template<typename T>
T sum(const T a[], int n) // could sum up ints, chars... strings(?)
{
  // T total = 0;         // no constructor for strings with just an int...
  // T total;             // would work for strings now, starts as empty string
                          // but for primitives, would be uninitialized
  T total = T();          // calls default constructor for strings, appropriate value for built-in types (0 false, nullptr)
  for (int k = 0; k < n; k++)
    total += a[k];
  return total;

  string x(10, '*');
  cout << x;               // if only using an object once, can use temporary object
  cout << string(10, 'x'); // string of 10 stars
  double(x);               // can also use this syntax for built-in types with appropriate value (0, false, nullptr)
}
```

### Template Errors

- used to have vague compile error messages when using templates
  - hard to track down errors across multiple functions, eg. code example below
    - only pointer is being passed
  - we _never see_ the function compiled from template
- now compilers provide a _traceback_ of function calls

```c++
template<typename T>
void g(T x)
{
  T y(x);
  minimum(x, y);
}
template<typename T>
void f(T x)
{
  g(x);
}
int main()
{
  f(i); // int
  f(d); // double
  f(c); // chicken, compiler error!
}
```

## Class Templates

- making a stack class:
  - could use a type alias for different types
  - but what about different stack types in the _same_ program
  - **class templates** solve this
- write a **pattern** for manufacturing classes!
- similar syntax:
- special syntax for returning an internal struct!

```c++
template<typename T>
class Stack
{
 public:
  Stack();
  Stack(const Stack<T>& other);
  Stack<T>& operator=(const Stack<T>& rhs);
  void push(const T& x);
  T top() const;
  int size() const; // should stil return an int!
  ...
  SomeStruct returnStruct();
  SomeStruct* returnStructPtr();
  ...
 private:
  T m_data[100];
  int m_top;

  struct SomeStruct
  {
    T temp;
    int tempNum;
    ...
  }
}

template<typename T>
inline T Stack<T>::someInlineFunc(T a) {}

template<typename T>
Stack<T>::Stack() : m_top(0) {}

template<typename T>
Stack<T>::Stack(const Stack<T> other) {}

template<typename T>
Stack<T>& Stack<T>::operator=(const Stack<T> rhs) {}

template<typename T>               // for every function, have to restate the template
void Stack<T>::push(const T& x) {} // works on a stack of T's

template<typename T>
T Stack<T>::top() const {}

template<typename T>
typename Stack<T>::SomeStruct Stack<T>::returnStruct() {}

template<typename T>
typename Stack<T>::SomeStruct* Stack<T>::returnStructPtr() {}

int main()
{
  Stack<int> si;       // manufactures constructor, destructor
  si.push(3);          // known to be a stack of ints, manufactures push function with ints
  Stack<Coord> sc;     // manufactures constructor, destructor
                       // error if Coord has no default constructor!
  sc.push(Coord(3,5)); // manufactures push with Coords
}
```

### Template Specialization

```c++
template<> // can define specific behaviors for chars, such as uppercase / lowercase
class Pair<char>
{
  // must redefine entire class!
  // (also possible to only specialize certain functions)
  ...
}
```

## Object Oriented Design Steps

- generally, two phases:
  - determine overall class design
  - determine class data structures / algorithms
- _class design_:
  1. classes and objects necessary
  2. outward-facing functionality
  3. data each class holds
  4. how they interact
- _class design steps_:
  1. identify potential **classes**
  - _nouns_ in the spec.!
  - eg. calendar, appointments, time-slot, password, start-time, end-time, participants
    - narrow down into classes (calendar, appointment)
  2. identify **operations**
  - what actions need to be performed in spec (_verbs_!)
  - eg. add new appnt., remove existing, check other users' calendars, supply password
    - associate actions with classes (functions)
  3. determine _relationships & data_
  - _general relationships_:
    - Class A **uses** objects of class B, not necessarily contains
    - Class A **has-a** (contains) objects of class B (**composition**)
    - Class A **is-a** specialized version of class B
    - this determines private data & inheritance
    - eg. calendar contains appointments, has a password, uses other calendars
  4. determine **interactions**
  - determine how each class interacts with the others
  - come up with _use-cases_:
    - eg. user wants to add (locate, update) an appointment, determine if they have an appointment
  - class design is an **iterative** process!
- _tips_:
  - **avoid** using dynamic cast to identify common types of objects
    - instead add functions to check for various _classes of behaviors_
    - eg. if (p->requiresOilToOperate()) ...
  - **avoid** defining specific isClass() functions for every object
    - instead add functions to check for various _common behaviors_
  - **avoid** duplication of member variables in related subclasses
    - instead move to base class with accessor / mutator methods
  - **never** make data members public or protected
    - class constants may be, however
  - **never** make a function public if only used in class that holds it
    - instead private or protected
  - **never** return list / vector / iterator / pointers to private objects
    - instead do all the processing within the class if action needs to be taken

## Administrative

- Midterms 1/30, 2/26
- Final 3/16
- Start early, develop incrementally, read what you write !!!

## 1.18.19

- Can use Valgrind tool to detect memory leaks
- Class Composition
  - when class contains member variables that are objects
  - Order of Construction (_inside to outside_)
    - member variables constructed in order (in order of the _member variable listing_, member initialization list doesn't matter)
    - then current class constructor
  - Order of Destruction (_outside to inside_)
    - current class destructor called first
    - member variables destructed in **reverse** order
  - class composition != class **inheritance**
- Copy Constructors
  - _shallow copy_ just copies all data members
  - _deep copy_ (redefine default copy constructor) is needed in the cases of pointers / when not **SHARING** the same adresses / using dynamic memory
  - similar to writing assignment operator (make sure to delete current dynamic memory and return \*this at the end)
- Data Structures
  - 3 functions
    - how to store and organize
    - how to add and remove data
    - how to apply functions (eg. search data)
  - add, contain, remove...
  - Pros / cons for every structure and differing efficency / complexity

## 2.1.19

- **Linked Lists**:
  - made up of Nodes with **value** and **pointer**
  - _head pointer_ points to first term
  - loop-free
  - **variations**:
    - doubly linked, sorted, circular
  - **Operations**:
    - insertion, search, removal
  - **pros**: efficient insertion, flexible memory, simple implementation
  - **cons**: complex searching and delete
