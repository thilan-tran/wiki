# CS213A: Embedded Systems
***

- an **embedded system** is a computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints:
    - vs. general-purpose computers that support a wider range of needs and typically do not have physical world interaction
    - eg. home thermometers, smart speakers, smart watches, Roombas, self driving technologies:
        - embedded systems make rich inferences about contexts, life patterns, behaviors, intents
        - diverse domains include health, transportation, security, entertainment, etc.
    - embedded trends include networked, miniaturization, human-coupling, AI-enabled, security and hacking concerns

- these embedded systems are typically connected to the Internet, ie. **Internet of Things (IoT)** devices:
    - IoT devices are these embedded computing devices that are interconnected in the Internet
        - allows for advanced connectivity of devices, systems, services
    - these "things" now dominate the edge of the internet rather than traditional computers
    - unique challenges include security, privacy, and configuration
    - *passive* IoT devices unilaterally upload sensor data
        - while *active* IoT devices upload data while also reading and analyzing results
    - common three-tier IoT systems:
        - the actual **embedded system** or device that senses, actuates, buffers, processes, provides UI
        - a **gateway** that relays, senses, buffers, processes, provides UI
        - the **cloud services** that archive, process, disseminate

- other related concepts:
    - **ubicomp** or ubiquitous computing, where computing can be made to appear anytime and everywhere in everyday life
    - **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)** have perception-cognition-action loops:
        - integrates computation, networking, sensing, and physical processes
        - build upon embedded systems with modeling of physical processes and their dynamics
    - **edge computing** and **fog computing** aim to extend the cloud closer to the devices producing and consuming the data:
        - edge computing is a paradigm where much processing occurs on the end device, rather than in the centralized cloud
        - fog computing is a similar paradigm where processing occurs on network nodes near the end device

# Embedded Hardware Platforms
***

- a generic embedded system platform has the following components:
    - human interface to interact with users
    - sensors and actuators to interact with the physical world
    - network and I/O interface to interact with servers and other devices
    - computation and storage system
    - power subsystem

- computation options:
    - custom SoC with ASIC or FPGA
    - custom board with COTS components
    - custom system using standard chassis like PCI, peripheral cards, etc.
    - use standard platform eg. ruggedized PC
    - specific ICs typically take least power and are fastest, while microprocessors and more flexible computation options take more power and are less fast
        - in terms of cost, mass volume production of specific ICs or SoCs will bring down their prices significantly
    - microcontroller units (MCUs) are the most common option:
        - microcontrollers package a microprocessor (CPU) with RAM, ROM, I/O, etc.

- power management options:
    - lower-power reduced-functionality modes (dynamic power management):
        - eg. idle, stop clock, power off, etc.
        - save power by changing modes
    - frequency scaling (dynamic frequency scaling) requires an appropriate clocking subsystem
        - power is proportional to frequency
    - voltage and frequency scaling (dynamic voltage-frequency scaling)
        - power is proportional to frequency and voltage squared
    - ideally, we want high performance for intensive workloads:
        - while conserving energy as workloads mitigate
        - can switch scaling type depending on workload type
        - one approach is big-little, where we have two cores that can be used depending on workload eg. by tracking a weighted average of CPU load

- I/O options:
    - inputs can include keyboard, mouse, pointing devices, speech
        - outputs can include monitor, projector, displays, audio
    - challenges include performance requirements eg. data rate, latency, synchronization
        - pin constraints, power supply requirements
    - typical supported API are get & set parameters, transmit & receive data, enabled & disable functions
    - I/O compared to data and program memory:
        - I/O device registers can't cache
        - timing matters
        - reading and writing can trigger hardware to perform some function
        - sharing across applications can be challenging
    - one technique is to have specialized I/O instructions just for I.O
        - restrict to kernel mode
    - another technique is to have memory-mapped I/O:
        - access devices just like they are memory
        - while using memory protection mechanisms

- pin types:
    - **general purpose I/O (GPIO)** pins are digital pins that can be read and written by software
        - eg. control external peripherals, LEDs, software serial protocols, etc.
    - analog I/O pins can be read and written by software:
        - AI pins perform analog to digital conversion at a certain bit resolution
        - AO pins perform digital to analog to digital conversion
        - **pulse width modulation (PWM)** is another way to convey analog values on a single digital pin using varying duty cycles

- serial interface protocols:
    - *pros*: serial interfaces reduce the pin counts, avoiding timing issues
    - *cons*: may need clock recovery and are difficult to memory map
    - eg. UART / RS232, I2C, SPI
    - synchronous vs. asynchronous is whether data is sent with or without a clock
    - full duplex vs. half duplex is whether data can be sent and received simultaneously or not
    - in a master / slave approach, one device is the master and others are slaves
        - usually synchronous, as the master supplies the timing clock for data in both directions
    - in a multi-master bus, the master / slave bus may have more than one master
        - needs an arbitration scheme
    - in a point-to-point or peer interface approach, there are no masters or slaves
        - usually asynchronous
    - in a multi-drop approach, there is one transmitter and several receivers
    - in a multi-point approach, there are more than two peer transceivers allowing for bidirectional data exchange

- UART and RS-232 are a common serial interface found on MCUs and peripherals:
    - products that support RS-232 are called **universal asynchronous receiver transmitters (UARTs)**
    - unbalanced bus capable of full-duplex communication between two receiver / transmitter pairs
    - speeds up to 115.2 Kbps, with distance up to over 200 feet
    - typically consists of a start bit, data bits, and parity or stop bits (optional)
    - logic high typically is a negative voltage, while logic low is a positive voltage
    - communication protocol:
        1. start bit indicates a character is coming, and receiver resets its timers
        2. then, the receiver samples in the middle of the bits using a timer
            - transmission rate ie. bit width must be known!
        3. stop bit should be `1`

- the **inter-integrated circuit (I2C)** bus is another popular, patented interface:
    - half-duplex, synchronous, multi-master bus requiring only two signal wires, data (SDA) and clock (SCL)
    - these lines are pulled high via pull-up resistors and controlled by the hardware via open-drain drivers
    - I2C is an addressable communications protocol:
        - allows master to communicate with individual slaves
        - 7 or 10-bit address
    - master initiates communication and generates all clock signals for data transfer in either direction
        - through clock stretching, the slave can pull SCL low if it needs more time to process data bits
    - three speeds include slow or 100 Kbps, fast or 400 Kbps, and high-speed or 3.4 Mbps
        - each speed is downward compatible
    - communication protocol:
        1. master generates a start condition
            - start condition is a high-to-low transition of SDA while SCL is high
        2. master sends an 8-bit data word
            - data bit transitions take place while SCL is low
        3. the receiver generates the acknowledge bit:
            - pulls SDA low while master releases the line and allows it to float high
            - if the acknowledge bit is read by the master as high, it should consider the last communication word as not received
        4. master generates a stop condition or a repeated start
            - stop condition is a low-to-high transition of SDA while SCL is high

- the **serial peripheral interface (SPI)** is a synchronous serial bus with multi-master / slave protocol:
    - present on many microcontrollers
    - four signals are master out slave in (MOSI), master in slave out (MISO), serial clock (SCK), and active-low slave select (/SS)
    - allows for data rates over 1 Mbps in full duplex mode
    - generally limited to on-board communications and short traces
    - data is clocked simultaneously into slave and master based on SCK pulses:
        - master supplies the SCK
        - allows for four different clocking types based on polarity and phase of SCK
    - typically requires many pins when using multiple slaves

- other I/O interfaces:
    - Microwire similar to SPI
    - 1-wire
    - USB, which allows devices to switch back and forth between host and device
