# CS174: Introduction to Computer Graphics
***

- computer graphics is the field of creating imagery by computer
    - used in the entertainment industry eg. movies and games, visualization applications, etc.

- basic elements of CG include:
    - **modeling** ie. mathematically representing objects:
        - constructing models for specific objects
        - makes use of 3D points, lines, curves, surfaces, polygons
            - volumetric vs. image-based representations
        - primitives can have attributes like colors and texture maps
    - **animation** ie. representing the motions of objects:
        - also give animators control of the motion
        - eg. keyframe animation, motion capture, procedural animation
    - **rendering** ie. simulating the real-world behavior of light and formation of images:
        - simulate light propagation
            - includes 3D scene, lighting, point-of-view, shading, projection
        - properties include reflection, absorption, scattering, emission, interference
    - **interaction** ie. enabling humans and computers to interact

# Basic Graphics System
***

- a basic graphics system includes:
    - input devices
    - CPU and GPU:
        - CPU takes input from the user, and calculates how the world should update accordingly
        - CPU passes to GPU the world changes, and GPU generates an image that can be stored as a **framebuffer**
    - computing and rendering system
    - output devices
        - takes in framebuffer and displays it on the screen scanline by scanline

## Output Devices
***

- in **cathode ray tube (CRT)** technology, electrons strike phosphorous coating and emit light:
    - direction of electron beam controlled by deflection plates
    - with random-scan or vector CRT, can only "burn" lines into the screen:
        - deflection plates randomly target different parts of the screen to burn in points
        - difficult to fill polygons, etc.
    - refresh rate between 60 to 85 Hz
        - burning only lasts a few milliseconds

- in **raster CRT**, the screen is broken up into pixels eg. $n$ by $m$ phosphorous cells:
    - a pixel becomes the smallest element we can modify on the screen
    - intrinsically has a rasterizing or aliasing problem due to finiteness of pixels
    - framebuffer depth determines color complexity:
        - 1 bit supports black and white
        - 8 bits gray scale
        - 8 bits per color (RGB) requires 24 bits and creates 16 M colors
        - 12 bits per color is HD
    - 3 different colored electron guns
        - each pixel has 3 different colors phosphors arranged in triads
    - a shadow mask helps to prevent electron beams from bleeding over into neighboring pixels
    - **interlaced** displays update odd to even scanlines:
        - rather than every scanlines, as in **non-interlaced** displays
        - human eye cannot catch the difference, while data bandwidth requirement is halved since only half of the framebuffer needs to be sent
    - potential race condition with the framebuffer:
        - as GPU is updating the framebuffer, the display may be reading it at the same time
        - instead, **double buffering** uses two framebuffers to avoid this data conflict

- typical screen resolutions:
    - TV is 640x480
    - HD is 1920x1080
    - 4K LCD is 3840x2160
    - 35mm is 3000x2000

- memory speed and space requirements:
    - given $n \times m$ resolution, refresh rate $r$ Hz, color depth $b$ bits per pixel
    - memory space per second is $\frac{n*m*b*r}{8}$ bytes
    - if non-interlaced, memory read time is $\frac{1}{n*m*r}$ seconds per pixel
    - if interlaced, memory read time is $\frac{2}{n*m*r}$ seconds per pixel

- flat screen displays no longer have a CRT:
    - still raster based, with an active matrix of transistors at grid points
        - vertical grid plus horizontal grid of wires allows voltages to be customized along the grid to change the lighting at each pixel
    - light sources for pixels may be:
        - **light emitting diodes (LEDs)**
        - **polarized liquid crystals (LCDs)**
        - **plasma**, where gases are energized to glow

## Modeling Objects
***

- a sphere may be most easily modeled by its origin and radius:
    - however, this is not easiest model to render in graphics
        - complicated non-linear formulas
    - we only know how to render polygons
    - need to **discretize** the *surface* of the object into polygons:
        - essentially linearizing shapes into line segments
        - loses information of the inside of the object
    - eg. to tesselate a circle, can arrange many triangles around the origin

- polygons can be represented as collection of points connected with lines:
    - eg. for vertices $v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4$, the connecting edges are assumed to be $v_1v_2, v_2v_3,v_3v_4,v_4v_1$
        - to model, represent with a list of vertices with their coordinates and then a list of faces with their vertices
    - the **normal** of a polygon should face outward from the face
        - thus vertices of faces are typically ordered counter-clockwisee
    - considerations include:
        - closed / open
            - whether the last closing edge is inferred
        - wireframe / filled
            - generally only consider wireframe polygons (discretized)
        - planar / non-planar:
            - non-planar polygons span multiple planes
            - thus the normal points in different directions on the same polygon
        - convex / concave:
            - concave polygons have internal angles that are greater than $180^\circ$
            - thus the normal points in the wrong direction at some concave vertices
        - simple / non-simple
            - non-simple polygons intersect on themselves

- if we deal with only triangles, we satisfy many desired polygonal considerations:
    - simple, convex, and planar
    - modern GPUs can render 100 million triangles per second

- how can we check if a point is inside a polygon?
    - a point is *inside* a convex polygon if it lies to the *left* of all the directed edges
        - in a convex polygon, the directed edges point counter-clockwise and the normals of two consecutive edges are always consistent
    - for concave polygons, these useful properties do not hold
        - want to break up concave polygons into convex ones

\newpage{}

# Transformations
***

- **translations** can be written as:
$$ \begin{bmatrix} x'\\y' \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} T_x\\T_y \end{bmatrix}+ \begin{bmatrix} x\\y \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} T_x+x\\T_y+y \end{bmatrix}$$

- **scalings** can be written as:
$$ \begin{bmatrix} x'\\y' \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} S_x&0\\0& S_y \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} x\\y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} S_xx\\S_yy \end{bmatrix}$$
    - note that scaling happens with respect to the origin:
        - scaling greater than one moves away from the origin, while scaling less than one moves towards the origin
        - negative scales flip across the axis

- **rotations** can be written as the following, where $\theta$ is the angle of rotation and $r$ is the distance of the initial point from the origin:
$$ \begin{bmatrix} x'\\y' \end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta& -\sin\theta\\\sin\theta& \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x\\y \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix} x\cos\theta-y\sin\theta\\x\sin\theta+y\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}$$
    - rotations also happen with respect to the origin
    - counter clockwise rotations are positive, while clockwise rotations are negative

- **shears** can be written as:
$$ \begin{bmatrix} x'\\y' \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix} 1&a\\0&1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x\\y \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix} x+ay\\y \end{bmatrix}$$
    - this is a horizontal shear

- transforming lines and polygons:
    - if we can *preserve* the linearity of the line, we only have to transform the endpoints of the line or polygon instead of all the contained or connected points
    - affine transformations on endpoints guarantee that straight lines will remain straight lines after the transformation!
        - ie. affine transformations preserve affine combinations eg. line segment interpolations
    - affine transformations also preserve planarity, parallelism, and relative ratios of edge lengths

- these transformations can be *stacked* by appending matrices together:
    - eg. $M_R \times M_S \times M_S \times M_R \times \ldots \times M_P = M_T \times M_P$
    - multiplying onto the left, AKA post-multiplication:
        - note that order matters!
        - except for special cases, such as pure transformations of a single type being commutative
            - eg. pure translations, pure scalings, pure rotation about an axis
    - can create a single transformation matrix out of the individual transformations
        - to all points, apply the single transformation matrix
    - however, translation is a matrix addition rather than a matrix multiplication:
        - cannot coalesce into a single transformation matrix!
        - however, with homogeneous representation, we can bypass this issue and treat translation as matrix multiplication

- homogeneous transformations:
\begin{align*}
T&= \begin{bmatrix} 1&0&T_x \\ 0&1&T_y \\0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\1 \end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix} x+T_x\\y+T_y\\1 \end{bmatrix}\\
S&= \begin{bmatrix} S_x&0&0\\0&S_y&0\\0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\1 \end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix} S_xx\\S_yy\\1 \end{bmatrix}\\
R&= \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta&-\sin\theta&0\\\sin\theta&\cos\theta&0\\0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\1 \end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix} x\cos\theta-y\sin\theta\\x\sin\theta+y\cos\theta\\1 \end{bmatrix}\\
Sh_x&= \begin{bmatrix} 1&a&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\1 \end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix} x+ay\\y\\1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

- 3D transformation matrices:
\begin{align*}
T&= \begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&T_x\\0&1&0&T_y\\0&0&1&T_z\\0&0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}\\
S&= \begin{bmatrix} S_x&0&0&0\\0&S_y&0&0\\0&0&S_z&0\\0&0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}\\
R_z&= \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta&-\sin\theta&0&0\\\sin\theta&\cos\theta&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}\\
Sh_x&= \begin{bmatrix} 1&a&0&0\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
    - note that this rotation is happening *around* the z-axis, since the z-coordinates are unchanged
    - note that this shear is a purely horizontal shear along the x-axis

- the **general rotation matrix (GRM)** is a shortcut rotation matrix, given the orthonormal unit vectors of the rotated basis, say $i,j,k$, to rotate them *back* onto the normal axes:
$$GRM= \begin{bmatrix} i_x&i_y&i_z&0\\j_x&j_y&j_z&0\\k_x&k_y&k_z&0\\0&0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}$$
    - looking at the $3\times3$ submatrix in the upper left, the first row is exactly $i$, the second row is exactly $j$, and the third row is exactly $k$
        - these are the $\theta$ projections used in the rotation transformation
    - to inverse, since orthornormal, we can just take the transpose, where the basis vectors are column vectors
        - this inverse is exactly how to transform normal axes *into* the rotated basis ie. change of basis transformation

- consider the $3\times 3$ submatrix in the upper left of each of these 3D transformations:
    - each of the rows in this submatrix can be taken as a vector, and the dot product of any of these two rows in the submatrix equals 0
    - an affine transformation has this property, where the upper left $3\times3$ submatrix is orthogonal
    - translations and rotations are **rigid body transformations** since the lines, angles, and distances between points do not change:
        - the upper left $3\times3$ submatrix is orthonormal ie. vectors are orthogonal and unit vectors
        - note that scaling and shears are *not* rigid body transformations, since the vectors are not normalized (orthogonal, but *not* orthonormal)
        - for orthonormal matrices, $A^{-1}=A^T$

- rotations around the other axes:
\begin{align*}
R_x&= \begin{bmatrix} 1&0&0&0\\0&\cos\theta&-\sin\theta&0\\0&\sin\theta&\cos\theta&0\\0&0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}\\
R_y&= \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta&0&-\sin\theta&0\\0&1&0&0\\\sin\theta&0&\cos\theta&0\\0&0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

- shear along the x and y-axes:
$$ \begin{bmatrix} 1&0&a&0\\0&1&b&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}$$
    - the z-axis is locked, and shearing occurs on the other two axes

## Inverses
***

- inverse transformations:
\begin{align*}
T^{-1}&= \begin{bmatrix} 1&0&-T_x \\ 0&1&-T_y \\0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\1 \end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix} x-T_x\\y-T_y\\1 \end{bmatrix}\\
S^{-1}&= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{S_x}&0&0\\0&\frac{1}{S_y}&0\\0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\1 \end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix} \frac{x}{S_x}\\\frac{y}{S_y}\\1 \end{bmatrix}\\
R^{-1}(\theta)&= R(-\theta)\\
Sh_x^{-1}(a) &= Sh_x(-a)
\end{align*}

## Combining Transformations
***

- how can we rotate by $\theta$ around an arbitrary point $(x_R, x_Y)$, instead of just the origin?
$$M = T(x_R,y_R)R(\theta)T(-x_R,-y_R)$$
    1. translate reference point to the origin
    2. rotate
    3. translate reference point back to its original location

- how can we scale an object by $k$ in place?
$$M = T(x_R,y_R)S(k)T(-x_R,-y_R)$$
    - normally, scaling only happens with respect to the origin:
        - the object will move away from its original location if it is not centered
        - we want to scale the object while retaining its position
    1. translate reference point (eg. bottom left corner of object) to the origin
    2. scale
    3. translate reference point back to its original location

- how to find a point's new coordinates after a change of basis ie. frame of reference?
    - given the basis vectors defining the new basis, simply apply the inverse transformation in the change of basis to the point to get new coordinates
    - eg. if we have a new frame of reference with origin $(6,2)$, we can translate all points by $(-6,-2)$ to get new coordinates
        - similarly for stacked transforms eg. rotated and translated basis, have to inverse translate and then inverse rotate

- how to rotate a point by $\theta$ around a vector (with base point $P_R$)?
$$M = T(P_R)R_y(-\phi_y)R_z(-\phi_z)R_x(\theta)R_z(\phi_z)R_y(\phi_y)T(-P_R)$$
    1. first, we need to align the vector to an axis
        - move vector base to origin, then rotate other axes so that the vector lies on some axis eg. x-axis
    2. rotate around the aligned axis
    3. move vector to original location
        - rotate other axes, and then translate back

# Rendering Pipeline
***

## World and Camera
***

- we need to define a **camera** or reference frame through which to view our world:
    - we can build a camera coordinate system that can be represented by a matrix
    - requires an **eye vector** to represent the eye direction, as well as a **top vector** to describe the tilt of the camera
    - three orthogonal vectors can be generated as follows:
        1. eye vector is the first vector
            - can also be represented by an **eye point** and **reference point**
        2. then, we need a vector orthogonal to the plane of the eye and top vectors, so we can take the cross product
        3. take the cross product of the first two bases

- camera basis vectors:
\begin{align*}
k &= \frac{P_{ref}-P_{eye}}{|P_{ref}-P_{eye}|} \\
i &= \frac{v_{up}\times k}{|v_{up}\times k|}\\
j &= k \times i
\end{align*}

- general graphics pipeline:
    1. first, we want to place various models into our **worldspace**:
        - we perform various transformations such as translations, rotations, etc.
        - these are collapsed into a single transformation matrix that is applied to all vertices
    2. then, to view this world through a camera ie. eye view:
        - we need to change our frame of reference to the camera's
        - need to translate the eye point back to the origin, and rotate the camera bases
            - essentially, eye is at origin, looking down the z-axis, and head is upright
        - however, the x-axis from the eye's *point of view* has been flipped!
            - points left instead of right
            - we need to mirror on the yz-plane
        - use the following transformation matrix:
$$M = Mirror_x \times GRM(i,j,k) \times T(-P_{eye})$$
    - note that we can combine these matrices from different stages together!
        - transformation matrix (TM), eye matrix (EM), and an upcoming projection matrix (PM) can be pre-multiplied to avoid unnecessary matrix multiplies

- the mirror matrix on the yz-plane is as follows:
$$Mirror_x = \begin{bmatrix} -1&0&0&0\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}$$

## Projections
***

- now that everything is in eye space, we still have to perform something called a **projection**:
    - need to take a 3D object in space, and capture it *onto* a plane to display to the user
    - draw projection lines from a center of projection to the vertices of the object in space
        - the intersection of these projected vertices to the projection plane forms the projection image
    - two types of projections:
        - **parallel projection**, where the eye is placed at infinity away
            - view volume is a parallelepiped
        - **perspective projection**, where the eye's location gives a sense of depth to the projection:
            - view volume is more of a truncated pyramid, with **clipping planes** of different sizes that cut off the viewing volume
            - a viewing angle in x and y determine the slopes of this pyramid
        - having a front clipping plane prevents division by zero errors
            - during projection, usually divide by distance from eye

- in a parallel projection, all we have to do is throw away the z-coordinate:
$$Parallel_M = \begin{bmatrix} 1&0&0&0\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}$$
    - the view volume is a parallelepiped of certain dimension
        - any vertices lying outside of the box should be clipped and not rendered
    - we can create a unit or normalized **parallel canonical view volume** that extends between -1 and 1 in the xy-plane and from 0 to 1 in the z-direction
    - we can map an arbitrary view volume into a canonical one with the following normalized matrix:
$$Normal_M = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{2}{W}&0&0&0\\0&\frac{2}{H}&0&0\\0&0&\frac{1}{F-N}&\frac{-N}{F-N}\\0&0&0&1 \end{bmatrix}$$
        - given width, height, far distance, and near distance of view volume

- in a perspective projection, we need to take into account where the projection plane lies between the eye and object position, say a distance $d$ from the eye:
$$Perspective_M = \begin{bmatrix} 1&0&0&0\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&\frac{1}{d}&0 \end{bmatrix}$$
    - simply use similar triangles in a ratio, we know that $\frac{x'}{d} = \frac{x}{z}$ ie. $x' = \frac{x}{z}d$
    - when applied to an arbitrary point, after normalization, the projected point is as desired:
\begin{align*}
Perspective_M \begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\z\\1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\z\\\frac{z}{d} \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{x}{z}d\\\frac{y}{z}d\\d\\1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
        - z-coordinates are lost, collapsed into a constant $d$

- how can we handle non-square projections of other aspect ratios?
    - given parameters aspect ratio $A_R = \frac{W}{H}$ and half angle of view in the x-axis $\theta_x = \theta$
        - note that $\tan \theta = \frac{W}{d}$, where $d$ is the distance of the projection screen from the eye
    - we can normalize our previous $x'$ to a canonical view volume by dividing by $\frac{W}{2}$ to get $x' = \frac{x}{z}\frac{2d}{W}$, and replace $d$ with $\theta$
    - similarly, we can do the same for the y-axis and use the aspect ratio to remove $H$ and get the following:
\begin{align*}
x' &= \frac{x}{z\tan\theta}\\
y' &= \frac{y}{z}\frac{2d}{H} = \frac{yA_R}{z\tan\theta}
\end{align*}
        - this constrains our new axes between $[-1,1]$, as in the canonical view volume
        - note that we are indeed dividing by the distance from the eye through z

- the perspective projection matrix for any aspect ratio is as follows:
$$Perspective_{M_{AR}} = \begin{bmatrix} 1&0&0&0\\0&A_R&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&\tan\theta&0 \end{bmatrix}$$
    - when applied to an arbitrary point, after normalization, the projected point is as desired:
\begin{align*}
Perspective_{M_{AR}} \begin{bmatrix} x\\y\\z\\1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x\\A_Ry\\z\\z\tan\theta \end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{x}{z\tan\theta}\\\frac{A_Ry}{z\tan\theta}\\\frac{1}{\tan\theta}\\1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
    - however, our z values are now constant, and the depth data is lost for future calculations

- importantly, note that this perspective division step, where we normalize our points, cannot be encapsulated in a $4\times4$ matrix
    - transformation, eye, and projection matrices can be combined together
    - but perspective division has to be done separately, before the window-to-viewport mapping step

- to fix the loss of our depth after perspective division, we can recover our z values as follows:
\begin{align*}
z' &= A + \frac{B}{z} \\
A &= \frac{F}{F-N}\\
B&= -\frac{NF}{F-N}
\end{align*}
    - given the distance of the near and far planes, $N$ and $F$
    - forms a system of equations where $z'=0$ if $z=N$, and $z'=1$ if $z=F$
    - the full normalized perspective projection matrix is as follows:
$$Perspective_{M_{AR}} = \begin{bmatrix} 1&0&0&0\\0&A_R&0&0\\0&0&A\tan\theta&B\tan\theta\\0&0&\tan\theta&0 \end{bmatrix}$$

## Viewport Mapping
***

- the final rendering stage is to map our viewing window to a viewport of arbitrary size:
$$M = T(V_L, V_B)S(\frac{V_R-V_L}{W_R-W_L}, \frac{V_T-V_B}{W_T-W_B})T(-W_L, -W_B)$$
    - requires viewport left, right, bottom, and top or $V_L, V_R, V_B, V_T$, respectively
        - as well as the same values for the window, if not normalized to the canonical window

## Linear Algebra Review
***

- **points** have a location, but no size, shape, or direction
    - lie on a coordinate plane
- **vectors** have a direction and length, but no location:
    - can define a vector along two basis vectors (in 2D)
    - vectors $v_i, \ldots, v_m$ are **linearly independent** if $a_1v_1+\ldots+a_mv_m=0$ iff. $a_i = 0$
        - ie. no projection of one vector on any of the others
    - **linear dependent** vectors are scalar multiples of each other

- a difference between two points is a vector $v = Q-P$
    - similarly, a base point plus bector offset is another point $Q = P+v$

- the **homogeneous representation** for points and vectors allows us to distinguish between the two:
    - a point is represented as $\begin{bmatrix} P_x\\P_y\\1 \end{bmatrix}$
    - a vector is represented as $\begin{bmatrix} V_x\\V_y\\0 \end{bmatrix}$
    - similarly for 3D, we have a 4th element to distinguish the two
    - we can now define vectors and points in matrix multiplication:
\begin{align*}
v &= \beta_1v_1+\beta_2v_2+\beta_3v_3 =
\begin{bmatrix} \beta_1 \enskip \beta_2 \enskip \beta_3 \enskip 0 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} v_1\\v_2\\v_3\\P_0 \end{bmatrix} \\
P &= P_0 + v = P_0+\alpha_1v_1+\alpha_2v_2+\alpha_3v_3\\
&= \begin{bmatrix} \alpha_1 \enskip \alpha_2 \enskip \alpha_3 \enskip 1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} v_1\\v_2\\v_3\\P_0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

- more operations in homogeneous representation:
\begin{align*}
v+w &= \begin{bmatrix} v_1\\v_2\\v_3\\0 \end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix} w_1\\w_2\\w_3\\0 \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} v_1+w_1\\v_2+w_2\\v_3+w_3\\0 \end{bmatrix}\\
av + bw &= a \begin{bmatrix} v_1\\v_2\\v_3\\0 \end{bmatrix}+
b\begin{bmatrix} w_1\\w_2\\w_3\\0 \end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix} av_1+bw_1\\av_2+bw_2\\av_3+bw_3\\0 \end{bmatrix}\\
P+v &= \begin{bmatrix} p_1\\p_2\\p_3\\1 \end{bmatrix}+
\begin{bmatrix} v_1\\v_2\\v_3\\0 \end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix} p_1+v_1\\p_2+v_2\\p_3+v_3\\1 \end{bmatrix}\\
P-Q&= \begin{bmatrix} p_1\\p_2\\p_3\\1 \end{bmatrix}-
\begin{bmatrix} q_1\\q_2\\q_3\\1 \end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix} p_1-q_1\\p_2-q_2\\p_3-q_3\\0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

- linear combination in homogeneous representation:
$$aP+bQ=a \begin{bmatrix} p_1\\p_2\\p_3\\1 \end{bmatrix}+
b \begin{bmatrix} q_1\\q_2\\q_3\\1 \end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix} ap_1+bq_1\\ap_2+bq_2\\ap_3+bq_3\\a+b \end{bmatrix}$$
    - if affine, $a+b=1$, and the combination creates a point
    - if $a+b=0$, the combination creates a vector
    - otherwise, we can normalize the result so that the last element is 1
        - combination still creates a point

- a **vector space** is a space defined with respect to certain **basis vectors**:
    - eg. in 2D, we need two bases in order to define any unique vector
    - the magnitudes in the direction of the basis vectors, added together, defines any unique vector
        - eg. $v = v_x\overrightarrow{v_1} + v_y\overrightarrow{v_2} = v_xi+v_yj$
    - basis vectors do not necessarily have to be orthogonal, or even unit magnitude:
        - however, cannot be on the same line ie. linear dependent
        - good practice to have unit basis vectors to only specify direction

- a **generator set** is a set of vectors that generate a vector space:
    - for a vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$ we need minimum $n$ vectors to generate all vectors
    - a generator set with minimum size is called a **basis** for the specified vector space
        - basis is purely defined by vectors, and creates a vector space that only supports vectors

- a **frame** has a point of origin along with a basis, and creates an **affine space** that supports vectors and points

- the **dot product** of two vectors is defined as $v_1\cdot v_2 = |v_1||v_2|\cos\theta \enskip$:
    - alternatively $v_{1_x}v_{2_x} + v_{1_y}v_{2_y}$
    - a scalar value
    - when the dot product is 0, the vectors are orthogonal
    - when the dot product is negative, the angle is greater than 90 degrees
    - when the dot product is positive, the angle is less than 90 degrees
    - $|u|cos\theta$ gives the projection of vector $u$ on in the direction of $v$

- the **cross product** of two vectors gives a vector:
$$v=v_1\times v_2 = det \begin{bmatrix}
i & j & k \\ v_{1_x} & v_{1_y} & v_{1_z} \\ v_{2_x} & v_{2_y} & v_{2_z}
\end{bmatrix}$$
    - resultant vector is perpendicular to the plane of the two vectors, pointing as defined by the right-hand rule
    - $|a\times b|=|a||b|\sin\theta$
    - not commutative

- **polygons** can be defined as a set of directed edges or connected vectors
    - the vectors can be calculated as the differences between the connected points
- **lines** can be written in parametric form as $P = P_1 + \alpha \overrightarrow{d} \enspace$:
    - where $d = P_2-P_1$ and $P_1, P_2$ are the endpoints of the directed line pointing towards $P_2$
    - equivalently, $P = (1-\alpha)P_1 + \alpha P_2$
    - traces ie. interpolates a line between the two endpoints that is infinite in both directions

- adding points has no meaning, but by linearly combining them with additional constraints, we can interpolate useful constructs:
    - $P = \alpha_1P_1+\alpha_2P_2$ is a **linear combination**
    - with the condition $\alpha_1+\alpha_2=1$, the parametric equation becomes an **affine linear combination**
        - represents a point lying on the line passing through $P_1, P_2$ that is infinite in both directions
    - with the *additional* condition that $\alpha_i \geq 0$, the parametric equation becomes a **convex linear combination**:
        - represents a point on the line segment between $P_1, P_2$
        - note convex necessitates affine
    - if we only have the constraint $\alpha_i \geq 0$ (not affine), we have a **ray** that is infinite in one direction only

- consider defining a polygon in terms of parameteric form as $P = \alpha_1 P_1 +\ldots+\alpha_nP_n \enspace$:
    - without any constraints, we cannot guarantee that the interpolated points are on the same plane as the polygon i.e. only a linear combination
    - with constraint $\sum \alpha_i = 1$, we have an affine combination, and the interpolated points will lie on the same plane as the polygon
    - with additional constraint $\alpha_i \geq 0$, we have a convex combination, and the interpolated points will lie within the convex hull of the polygon

- the **convex hull** can be imagined as taking a string around pegs at each corner of the polygon:
    - technically, the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points of the actual polygon
    - can be larger than the actual drawn polygon

## Graphics Tips & Tricks
***

- to transform lines:
    1. described by 2 end points
        - if we are performing an affine transformation, we can simply transform the end points and connect the line since the points will remain collinear
    2. described by equation $y=mx+b$:
        - find two points, transform them, and connect the line
        - for translations, we can simply adjust $b$
        - for rotations, we can simply adjust $m$

- to transform planes:
    1. described by 3 non-collinear points
        - if we are performing an affine transformation, transform the points and draw the new plane
    2. described by plane equation $Ax+By+Cz+D=0$:
        - the normal is $(A,B,C)$
        - if $M_{point}$ is the matrix to transform a point, $M_{normal}={(M_{point}^T)}^{-1}$
            - for rigid body transformations, $M_{normal}=M_{point}$

- point in polygon test:
    1. if convex, check if point lies to the left of every edge
    2. extend a semi-infinite ray from the point:
        - if there are an odd number of intersections with the polygon, the point is inside, else outside
        - also works for concave polygons
    3. perform angle summation from the point to each pair of vertices:
        - if the sum of subtended angles is $360^\circ$, the point is inside, else outside
        - also works for concave polygons

- calculating a normal vector:
    1. give 3 consecutive convex vertices, simply find the cross product
    2. use summation method, which works for convex and concave polygons:
$$(\sum(y_i-y_j)(z_i+z_j), \sum(z_i-z_j)(x_i+x_j), \sum(x_i-x_j)(y_i+y_j))$$

- transformation matrices:
$$M = \begin{bmatrix} m_{11}&m_{12}&m_{13}&m_{14}\\
m_{21}&m_{22}&m_{23}&m_{24}\\
m_{31}&m_{32}&m_{33}&m_{34}\\
0&0&0&1
\end{bmatrix}$$
    - the upper-left $3\times3$ matrix defines rotations, shears, and scalings
    - $(m_{14}, m_{24}, m_{34})$ defines translations

- orthogonal transformation matrices:
    - eg. translations and rotations
    - for the upper-left $3\times3$ matrix in a $4\times4$ transformation matrix:
        - each row is a unit vector, and each row is orthogonal to the others
        - can be thought of rotating these vectors to align with the xyz-axis
    - determinant is 1
    - $M^{-1}=M^T$
    - preserves angles and lengths ie. is a rigid body transformation
