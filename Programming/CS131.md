# CS131: Programming Languages
***

## Introduction
***

- sample problem:
  - *input*: ASCII text
  - *output*: all words (consecutive alphabetic characters) sorted by frequencies

- Knuth, a famous Turing-winning computer scientist, wanted to write a comprehensive programming book
  - created TeX, a language for typsetting math equations and code fragments
  - allows for creating a scolarly paper discussing a program or source file, eg. in C or Pascal
- however, the code (Pascal) does not always equal the documentation (TeX)
  - despite programmers' best interests to keep them up-to-date and consistent
- to solve this, Knuth created a *unified* file with the code *and* the documentation *interleaved*
  - new programming paradigm called **literate programming**
- have another program that split the unified source file into a .tex and .pas file
  - run one way, the source file is compiled into a readable paper
  - the other way, the source file is compiled into a runnable program
- Knuth, in order to market his new paradigm, created a unified file that solves the above sample problem
  - the associated scolarly paper was published
  - the Pascal solution uses *hashed tries*, is very fast, and has error checking through its compiler

- however, the editor of Knuth's paper brought up an *alternative* approach using **pipelines**:
  - `tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n]' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn`
  - more readable, much shorter, and easier to write than the Pascal solution

- this is an issue fo the **choice of notation/programming language** between the languages programmers use to implement solutions:
  - advantages and disadvantages of using full-fledged OOP languages vs. scripting solutions vs. other programming language types

- **Sapir-Whorf hypothesis** on the varieties and constraints of natural language:
  1. no limit on structural diversity
    - eg. some languages are not *recursive*, ie. they have a limit on their length
  2. the languages we use to some extent influences how we use the world

- the above ideas also apply to programming languages:
  - there is a great *diversity* in programming languages:
    - **imperative** languages like C focus on using assignment and iteration
      - variables have current values, and order of execution is critical
    - **functional** languages like ML focus on using recursion and single-valued variables
    - **logic programming** languages express programs in terms of rules about logical inference
    - **object oriented** languages like Java focus on using objects, or a bundle of data and methods
    - language types can overlap
  - programming languages will also *evolve* and change over time

- *core* of programming languages:
  - principal and limitations of programming **models**
  - **notations** ie. languages for these models (often textual)
  - methods to evaluate strengths and weaknesses of different notations in different contexts
    - eg. maintainability, reliability, training cost, program development
    - also execution overhead, licensing fees, build overhead, porting overhead
    - choice of notation can also be political, eg. a company preference for a language

- language design *issues*:
  - orthogonality of parts
    - eg. implementation of functions and selection of types should be independent
      - eg. C is not orthogonal in that its functions cannot return an array type
  - efficiency
    - eg. CPU, RAM, energy, network access
  - simplicity, ie. ease of *implementation*
  - convenience, ie. easy of *usage*
    - eg. C provides many ways to increment a variable
  - safety
    - static, compile-time checking vs. dynamic, runtime checking
  - abstraction
    - a strength of object oriented languages
  - exceptions
  - concurrency
  - evolution/mutability of a language

## Syntax and Grammar
***

- *translation* stages of a C source file:
  - the file is translated from a series of literal character bytes into a string of **tokens** through **lexing**
    - comments and whitespace are ignored
    - some of the tokens are associated with symbols, eg. functions such as `main` and `getchar`
    - a **lexeme** is the literal token with its associated programming language metadata
  - a **parse tree** is constructed from the string of tokens through **parsing**
    - the root of the tree represents the entire program
    - eg. the children of a function in the tree would include its type, ID, subtrees for arguments and statements, and parentheses, brackets, and semicolons
    - eg. the children of a function call in the tree would include subtrees for the expression and parameters, and parentheses and semicolons
    - following the *fringes* or leaves of the tree recreates the string of tokens
    - different compilers lex and compile in one or two passes
  - the parse tree is *checked* for types, names, etc.
  - *intermediate* code is generated from the parse tree
    - convenient for the compiler writer
  - intermediate code is turned into assembly code
  - the assembly code is turned into object code by the assembler
  - the object code is turned into an executable by a linker
  - the executable is run by the loader

- grammar is concerned with the lexing and parsing stages of translation
  - the **syntax** of a programming language defines the form and structure of programs
    - ie. form independent of meaning
  - the **semantics** of a programming language dictates the behavior and meaning of programs
  - syntax without semantics: "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."
  - semantics without syntax: "Ireland has leprechauns galore."
  - ambiguity of syntax and semantics: "Time flies."

- *judging* syntax:
  - inertia, ie. what people are used to
    - eg. `3 + 4 * 5` in C vs. `3 4 5 * +` in Forth vs. `(+ 3 (* 4 5))` in Lisp
  - simplicity and regularity
    - Lisp (regularly defined using parentheses) and Forth (no need for parentheses for precedence) win out
  - readability
    - form should reflect meaning
    - eg. `if (x > 0 && x < n)` vs. `if (0 < x && x < n)`
  - writability and conciseness
  - redundancy
    - avoiding silly mistakes
    - eg. in C, you match declaration to use
  - unambiguity

- programming language **grammar** is a set of rules or definitions that describe how to build a **parse tree**
  - the tree grows downward, where the children of each node follows the forms defined by the grammar
    - the language is the set of all possible strings formed as the *fringes* of the parse trees
    - **parsing** a language string finds its parse tree
    - an abbreviated, simplified parse tree is an **abstract syntax tree (AST)**
  - for a simplified definition of English:
    - `<noun-phrase> ::= <article> <noun>`
    - `<sentence> ::= <noun-phrase> <verb> <noun-phrase>`
  - for a simple language using expressions with three variables:
    - `<exp> ::= <exp> + <exp> | <exp> * <exp> | ( <exp> ) | a | b | c`
    - this allows for expressions such as `a + b * c` and `((a+b) * c)`
    - a **recursive** grammar allowing for an *infinite* language
  - the language itself is a set of certain strings
    - a sentence is a member of that set
    - a string is a finite sequence of tokens, with a corresponding parse tree

### Backus-Naur Form
***

- **Backus-Naur form (BNF)** can be used to explicitly describe **context-free grammars (CFGs)**
- *parts* of grammar specified in BNF:
  - the **terminal symbols** or **tokens** are the smallest units of syntax (leaves of parse tree)
    - whitespace and comments are not tokens
    - includes identifiers, numbers, operators, **keywords** that are part of the language
      - certain keywords are **reserved words** that cannot be treated as identifiers
    - eg. strings and symbols, `if`, `!=`
  - the **non-terminal symbols** are the different kind of language constructs (interior nodes of parse tree)
    - listed in angle brackets
    - eg. sentences, statements, expressions
    - `<empty>` is a special non-terminal symbol
  - the **start symbol** is the non-terminal symbol at the root of the parse tree
  - a set of **productions** or **rules**
    - a production consists of a left-hand side, separator `::=`, and a right-hand side
      - left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol
      - right-hand side is a sequence of tokens or non-terminal symbols
      - can use `|` notation for multiple definitions
- other extended BNF metasymbols include `[ ]` for optional expressions, `{ }` for repeated expressions
- can alternatively use **syntax diagrams** (directional graphs) to express grammars

- some programming languages do not use CFGs:
  - Fortran, predates CFGs
  - typedefs in C allow for change token types
  - indentation rules in Python
    - whitespace becomes important, affects parsing

- writing a grammar is similar to writing a program:
  - *divide and conquer* the problem
  - eg. making a BNF grammar for Java variable declarations:
    - eg. `int a=1, b, c=1+2;`
    - `<var-dec> ::= <type-name> <declarator-list> ;`
    - `<type-name> ::= boolean | byte | short | int | long | char | float | double`
    - `<declarator-list> ::= <declarator> | <declarator> , <declarator-list>`
    - `<declarator> ::= <variable-name> | <variable-name> = <expr> `
    - ignores array declarations

- the previous examples do not consider tokens as individual characters
  - instead, they defined the **phrase structure** by showing how to construct parse trees
  - they do not define the **lexical structure** by showing how to divide program text into these tokens
    - languages can have a **fixed-format** lexical structure where columns in lines and end-of-line markers are significant to the interpretation of the language
    - or a **free-format** lexical structure where end-of-line markers are simply whitespace
- illustrates the two distinct parts of syntax definition:
  - the **scanner** or **lexer** scans the input file and converts it to a stream of tokens without whitespace and comments
    - note that the lexer scans *greedily*
      - eg. `a-----b` is interpreted as the syntactically incorrect `((a--)--) - b` instead of the syntactically correct `(a--) - (--b)`
  - the **parser** then reads the tokens and forms the parse tree

### Syntax and Semantics
***

- different grammars may generate the *same* language ie. they create parse trees with identical fringes
  - however, the internal *structures* of the parse trees may be very different
  - eg. `<subexp> ::= <var> - <subexp> | <var>` vs. `<subexp> ::= <subexp> - <var> | <var>`
    - both grammars could create the language `a - b - c`, but represent different computations and results
    - `a - (b - c)` vs. `(a - b) - c`
  - thus, when considering semantics, the semantics represented by unique parse trees must be *unambigious*

- consider the following grammar which has issues with precdence and associativity:
  - `<exp> ::= <exp> + <exp> | <exp> * <exp> | ( <exp> ) | a | b | c`

- dealing with **precedence**:
  - the grammar can generate different parse trees for `a + b * c`, including one where addition has higher precedence than multiplication, ie. `(a + b) * c`
  - the grammar must be modified to eliminate this erroneous tree:
    - `<exp> ::= <exp> + <exp> | <mulexp>`
    - `<mulexp> ::= <mulexp> * <mulexp> | ( <exp> ) | a | b | c`
    - essentially does not allow lower-precedence operators to occur in the subtrees of higher-precedence ones unless explicitly parenthesized
      - creates a level of precedence for multiplication

- dealing with **associativity**:
  - with subtraction instead of addition, the grammar can generate different parse trees for `a - b - c`
  - the grammar must only generate one parse tree for each expression
  - without parenthesis, most languages are **left-associative** and choose the `(a - b) - c` tree
    - examples of a right-associative operators are the assignment operator `=` and construct operator
  - the grammar must be modified:
    - `<exp> ::= <exp> + <mulexp> | <mulexp>`
    - `<mulexp> ::= <mulexp> * <rootexp> | <rootexp>`
    - `<rootexp> ::= ( <exp> ) | a | b | c`
    - the productions are only recursive on onse side of each operator
    - essentially does not allow left-associative operators to appear in the parse tree as the right child of another operator at the same level of precedence without parentheses
      - forces trees to grow down to the left

- dealing with other ambiguities, eg. the *dangling else* problem:
  - for if-statements with an optional `else`, multiple parse trees may be generated for the statement `if e1 then if e2 then s1 else s2`
  - could group as `if e1 then (if e1 then s1) else s2` or `if e1 then (if e2 then s1 else s2)`
  - most languages attach the `else` with the nearest unmatched `if`
  - the grammar must be modified:
    - add a new non-terminal symbol for the full if-else-statement
    - substitute the new symbol within the grammar:
      - `<if-stmt> ::= if <expr> then <full-stmt> else <stmt>`
    - grammar can only match an `else` with an `if` if all of the nearer `if` parts are already matched

## ML
***

- **ML** is a popular functional language
  - has a *standard* dialect (SML) and an *object-oriented* dialect (OCaml)
  - this chapter uses the SML-NJ dialect

- **functional**, functions are *first-class objects*, ie. they can be passed into functions and treated as any other variabels
- **immutable**, variables (including lists) cannot be modified
- uses **type inference** to automatically choose types
  - thus functions and operators can't have *overloaded* definitions
- never does **implicit** casts
- functions never **return**
  - the last expression in a function is its result

### Syntax
***

- literals:
  - `1234;` int constant
  - `123.4;` real constant
  - `~34;` int constant of -34 using negation operator `~`
  - `true;`, `false;` bool constants
  - `"fred";` string constant
  - `#"H";` char constant

- operators:
  - `12 div 5;` integer division
  - `7 mod 5;` modulo remainder
  - `~3;` negation
  - `12.0 / 5.0;` real division
  - `"tip" ^ "top";` concatenation
  - `< > <= >=` ordering comparison
  - `=` equality
    - cannot use equality operator with real numbers
  - `<>` inequality
  - `orelse andalso not` boolean operators
    - ML supports **short-circuit** evaluation
  - left-associative, typical precedence levels

- conditionals:
  - syntax: `<cond-expr> ::= if <expr> then <expr> else <expr>`
  - `(if 1 < 2 then 34 else 56) + 1;` gives int 35

- type conversion:
  - ML does not support mixed-type expressions or automatic type conversions
    - `1.0 * 2;` throws an error, multiplication is not **overloaded** for different operand types
  - `real(123);` gives 123.0 with type real
  - `floor(3.6);` gives 3 with type int
  - also `ceil round trunc` for real types
  - `ord chr str` for char and string operations

- function application:
  - can call functions *without* parentheses
  - `f(1)`, `(f)1`, `(f 1)`, `f 1` all equivalent
  - style is to use `f 1`
  - function application has the highest precedence, and is left-associative
    - `f a+1` is the same as `(f a) + 1`, `f g 1` is not the same as `f(g(1))`

- variable definition:
  - `val x = 1 + 2 * 3;`
  - `x;` gives 7 with type int
  - can use `val` to redefine an existing variable (new value or new type)
  - note that this is *not* like an assignment statement in imperative programming:
    - a new definition does not have side effects on other parts of the program
    - parts of the program using the old definition before redefinition is still using the old definition
  - the `it` variable always has the value of the last expression typed

- tuples:
  - `val barney = (1+2, 3.0*4.0, "brown");` gives `(3,12.0,"brown")` with type `int * real * string`
  - `val point = ("red", (100, 200));` gives `("red",(100,200))` with type `string * (int * int)`
    - `*` is a **type constructor** for tuples
    - the type `string * (int * int)` is a different type from `(string * int) * int`
  - `#2 barney;` gives 12.0 with type real (1-indexed)
  - `#1 (#2 point);` gives 100 with type int
  - note that a tuple of size one does not exist

- lists:
  - all elements are the same type
  - `[1, 2, 3];` gives `[1,2,3]` with type `int list`
    - `list` is a type constructor
  - `[true];` gives `[true]` with type `bool list`
  - `[(1,2), (1,3)]` gives `[(1,2),(1,3)]` with type `(int * int) list`
  - `[[1,2,3], [1,2]]` gives `[[1,2,3],[1,2]]` with type `int list list`
  - `nil` or `[]` is an empty list
    - has type `'a list`
    - names beginning with an apostrophe are **type variables** (unknown type)
  - `null` function checks whether a list is empty
  - `hd` function returns first element, `tl` function returns rest of list after first element
    - error on empty lists
  - `explode` function converts a string into a char list, `implode` function performs the opposite
  - `@` operator concatenates two lists of the same type
    - `[1,2] @ [3,4];` gives `[1,2,3,4]` with type `int list`
  - `::` operator pushes an element into the front of a list (*cons* or construct operator)
    - `1::[2,3];` gives `[1,2,3]` with type `int list`
    - used often for natural recursive constructions
    - right-associative, `1::2::3::[];` gives `[1,2,3]` with type `int list`

- function definitions:
  - syntax: `<fun-def> ::= fun <fun-name> <parameter> = <expression> ;`
  - `fun firstChar s = hd (explode s);` gives `firstChar` with type `fn : string -> char`
    - `->` is a type constructor for functions
    - domain and range types are automatically determined
  - `firstChar "abc"` gives `#"a"` with type char
  - for multiple parameters, use tuples:
    - `fun quot (a, b) = a div b;` gives `quot` with type `fn : int * int -> int`
    - `quot (6, 2);` gives 3 with type int
      - `val pair = (6, 2);`, `quot pair` gives the same result

- using recursion:
  - recursion is used heavily in ML
  - `fun fact n = if n = 0 then 1 else n * fact(n - 1);`
  - `fun listsum x = if null x then 0 else hd x + listsum(tl x);`
  - `fun length x = if null x then 0 else 1 + length(tl x);`
    - function `length` has type `fn : 'a list -> int`
    - indicates input is a list of elements with unknown type
    - this is a **polymorphic** function that allows parameters of different types
  - `fun badlength x = if x = [] then 0 else 1 + badlength(tl x);`
    - function `badlength` has type `fn : ''a list -> int`
    - indicates input is restricted to *equality-testable* types
    - function does not work on lists of reals, since reals cannot be tested for equality
      - due to `x = []` check
  - `fun reverse L = if null L then nil else reverse(tl L) @ [hd L]`

- types and type annotations:
  - type constructors include `* list ->`
  - `list` has the highest precedence, `->` has the lowest precedence
    - `int * int list` is the same type as `int * (int list)`
  - for the function `fun prod(a, b) = a * b;`, ML decides on the type `fn : int * int -> int`
    - ML uses the *default type* for the multiplication operator
    - to use with reals, have to include a **type annotation**
      - type annotations can be placed after any variable or expression, but best to keep it as readable as possible
    - `fun prod(a:real, b:real) : real = a * b;` has type `fn : real * real -> real`

### Patterns
***

- ML automatically tries to match values to certain **patterns**
  - patterns also introduce new variables
  - eg. patterns appear in function parameters:
    - `fun f n = n * n;`
      - the pattern `n` matches any parameter and introduces a variable `n`
    - `fun f (a, b) = a * b;`
      - the pattern `(a, b)` matches any tuple of two items and introduces two variables `a` and `b`

- more patterns:
  - `_` in ML matches anything and does not introduce any variables:
    - `fun f _ = "yes";` has type `fn : 'a -> string`
  - can match only a single constant:
    - `fun f 0 = "yes";` has type `fn : 'int -> string'` but with a warning for *non-exhaustive* matching
      - throws an error if called on an integer value that isn't 0
  - matching a list of patterns:
    - `fun f [a, _] = a;` has type `fn : 'a list -> 'a` but with a non-exhuastive matching warning
      - only matches lists with exactly two elements
  - matching a cons of patterns:
    - `fun f (x :: xs) = x;` has type `fn : 'a list -> 'a` but with a non-exhuastive matching warning
      - matches any non-empty list and introduces `x` bound to the head element and `xs` bound to the tail
      - almost exhaustive, but fails on the empty list

- the grammar for multiple pattern function definitions:
  - `<fun-def> ::= fun <fun-bodies> ;`
  - `<fun-bodies> ::= <fun-body> | <fun-body> '|' <fun-bodies>`
  - `<fun-body> ::= <fun-name> <pattern> = <expression>`

Using multiple function patterns:
```
(* type int -> string, non-exhaustive *)
fun f 0 = "zero"
  | f 1 = "one";
```
For overlapping patterns, ML tries patterns in order:
```
(* type int -> string, exhaustive *)
fun f 0 = "zero"
  | f _ = "non-zero";
```
Equivalently, in non pattern-matching style:
```
fun f n =
  if n = 0 then "zero"
  else "non-zero";
```
Rewriting functions in this style clearly separates base case from the recursive case:
```
fun fact 0 = 123
  | fact n = n * fact(n - 1);

fun reverse nil = nil
  | reverse (first :: rest) = reverse rest @ [first];

fun sum nil = 0
  | sum (first :: rest) = first + sum rest;

fun countTrue nil = 0
  | countTrue (true :: rest) = 1 + count_true rest
  | countTrue (false :: rest) = count_true rest;

fun incrAll nil = nil
  | incrAll (first :: rest) = first + 1 :: incr_all rest;
```
Restrictions of pattern-matching style:
```
(* the same variable cannot be used more than once in a pattern
 * fun f (a, a) = ...
   * | f (a, b) = ...;
 *)

(* cannot use pattern-matching *)
fun f (a, b) =
  if (a = b) then ...
  else ...;
```
Pattern-matching in variable definitions:
```
val (a, b) = (1,2.3);
val a :: b = [1,2,3,4,5];
```
### Local Variable Definitions
***

- the `let` expression allows for local variable definitions
  -  syntax: `<let-exp> ::= let <definitions> in <expression> end`
  - definitions cannot be accessed outside the environment of the `let`
  - the value of the evaluated expression is the value of the entire `let` expression

Using `let`:
```
let val x = 1 val y = 2 in x + y end;
(* it has value 3, x and y are unbound *)
```
Alternatively:
```
let
  val x = 123
  val y = 2cm
in
  x + y
end;
```
More practical example with `let`:
```
fun days2ms days =
  let
    val hours = days * 24.0
    val minutes = hours * 60.0
    val seconds = minutes * 60.0
  in
    seconds * 1000.0
  end;
```
`let` with function pattern-matching:
```
fun halve nil = (nil, nil)
  | halve [a] = ([a], nil)
  | halve (a :: b :: cs) =
      let
        val (x, y) = halve cs
      in
        (a :: x, b :: y)
      end;

fun merge (nil, ys) = ys
  | merge (xs, nil) = xs
  | merge (x :: xs, y :: ys) =
      if (x < y) then x :: merge(xs, y :: ys)
      else y :: merge(x :: xs, ys);

fun mergeSort nil = nil
  | mergeSort [e] = [e]
  | mergeSort theList =
      let
        val (x, y) = halve theList
      in
        merge(mergeSort x, mergeSort y)
      end;
```
### Case Expression
***

- syntax for a `case` expression:
  - `<rule> ::= <pattern> => <expression>`
  - `<match> ::= <rule> | <rule> '|' <match>`
  - `<case-exp> ::= case <expression> of <match>`

Although many languages have a case construct, ML's `case` allows for powerful general pattern matching:
```
(* returns the third element if 3+ elements, second if 2, first if 1, 0 if empty *)
case x of
  _ :: _ :: c :: _ => c |
  _ :: b :: _ => b |
  a :: _ => a |
  nil => 0
```
### Higher-Order Functions
***

- function names are variables just like any others in ML
  - the are just initially bound to a function
  - functions themselves do not *have* names
  - eg. can rebind the negation operator:
    - `val x = ~;`
    - `x 3;` gives -3 with type int
  - can *extract* the function itself from a builtin operator such as `>` using `op`
    - `quicksort([1,2,3,4,5], op >)` gives `[5,4,3,2,1]` if the quicksort function takes a list and a comparison function

- can create **anonymous** functions using the keyword `fn` followed by a match instead of `fun`:
  - `fun f x = x + 2;`  has the same effect as to `val f = fn x =>  + 2;`
    - except that only the `fun` definition has a scope including the function body, so only the `fun` version can be recursive
  - `(fn x => x + 2) 1;` gives 3 with type int

- **higher-order functions (HOFs)** are functions that take another function as a parameter or returns a function
  - functions that do not involve other functions have order 1 and are not higher-order
  - HOFs provide an alternative for squeezing multiple parameters into a single tuple:
    - using **currying** to write a function that takes the first parameter, and returns another function that takes the second parameter, etc., until the ultimate result is returned

Using currying:
```
fun f (a, b) = a + b;
f (2, 3);

fun g a = fn b => a + b;
g 2 3; (* same as (g 2) 3 *)
```
Calling curried functions with only some of their parameters:
```
val add2 = g 2;
val add3 = g 3;
add2 3; (* gives 5 *)
add3 3; (* gives 6 *)

(* defining quicksort as a curried function with type:
 * ('a * 'a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list
 * )
quicksort (op <) [1,4,3,2,5]; (* gives [1,2,3,4,5] *)
val sortBackward = quicksort (op >);
sortBackward [1,4,3,2,5]; (* gives [5,4,3,2,1] *)
```
Extending parameters:
```
fun f (a,b,c) = a + b + c;
f (1,2,3);

fun g a = fn b => fn c => a + b + c;
g 1 2 3;

fun g a b c = a + b + c; (* equivalent abreviation *)
```
#### Predefined Higher Order Functions

- the `map` function has the type `('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list`
  - applies some function to every element of a list, creating a list with the same size
  - `map ~ [1,2,3,4];` gives `[-1,-2,-3,-4]`
  - `map (fn x => x+1) [1,2,3,4];` gives `[2,3,4,5]`
  - `map (fn x => x mod 2 = 0) [1,2,3,4];` gives `[false,true,false,true]`
  - `map (op +) [(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)];` gives `[3,7,11]`

- the `foldr` function has the type `('a * 'b -> 'b) -> 'b -> 'a list  -> 'b -> 'a list -> 'b`
  - combines all the elements of a list into one value, starting from the rightmost element
  - takes a function, a starting value, and a list of elements
    - `foldr (fn (a,b) => ...) c x`
    - first call of anonymous function starts with `a` as rightmost element and `b` as `c`
    - then, `b` will hold the result accumulated so far
    - `b`, `c`, and the return value of `foldr` and the anonymous function are all the same type
    - `a` and the type of elements of `x` are the same type
    - `c` is returned when the list is empty
  - `foldr (op +) 0 [1,2,3,4];` gives 10
  - `foldr (op * ) 1 [1,2,3,4];` gives 24
    - need extra space to avoid comment delimiting
  - `foldr (op ^) "" ["abc","def","ghi"];` gives `"abcdefghi"`
  - `foldr (op ::) [5] [1,2,3,4];` gives `[1,2,3,4,5]`
  - `fun filterPositive L = foldr (fn (a,b) => if a < 0 then b else a::b) [] L;`

- the `foldl` function has the same type as `foldr`, but starts from the leftmost elements
  - same result as `foldr` for associative and commutative operations
  - `foldl (op ^) "" ["abc","def","ghi"];` gives `"ghidefabc"`
  - `foldl (op -) 0 [1,2,3,4];` gives 2 as opposed to -2 called with `foldr`

### Type and Data Constructors
***

- the `datatype` definition creates an enumerated type:
  - `datatype day = Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun;`
  - `fun isWeekDay x = not (x = Sat orselse x = Sun);`
  - the name of the type is a **type constructor** and the member names are **data constructors**
    - data constructors here act as *constants* in a pattern
  - the only permitted operators are comparisons for equality
  - the actual ML definition for booleans is `datatype bool = true | false;`

- a parameter to a data constructor can be added with the keyword `of`:
  - `datatype exint = Value of int | PlusInf | MinusInf;`
    - each `Value` will contain an int, `Value` itself is a function that takes an int and returns exint
    - `Value 3;` gives `Value 3` with type exint
    - however, cannot treat as an int and perform operations
    - have to extract using pattern matching:
      - `val x = Value 5;`, `val (Value y) = x;` gives 5 with type int

Pattern matching with data constructors:
```
(* exhaustive matching *)
val s = case x of
  PlusInf => "infinity" |
  MinusInf => "-infinity" |
  Value y => Int.toString y;

fun square PlusInf = PlusInf
  | square MinusInf = PlusInf
  | square (Value x) = Value (x * x);
```
- a type constructor can have parameters too, allowing for *polymorphic* type parameters:
  - `datatype 'a option = NONE | SOME of 'a;`
  - the type constructor is named `option` and takes type `'a` as a parameter
  - `SOME 4;` gives the type `int option`
  - `SOME 1.2;` gives the type `real option`
  - `SOME "pig";` gives the type `string option`

Polymorphic type parameter examples:
```
fun optdiv a b = if b = 0 then NONE else SOME (a div b);

datatype 'x bunch = One of 'x | Group of 'x list;
One 1.0; (* type real bunch *)
Group [true,false]; (* type bool bunch *)

fun size (One _) = 1
  | size (Group x) = length x;

(* here, ML resolves the returned type to int *)
fun sum (One x) = x
  | sum (Group xlist) = foldr (op +) 0 xlist;
```
### Recursion with Constructors
***

- type constructors can also be used *recursively*
  - eg. the actual list type definition in ML is recursive
  - `datatype 'element list = nil | :: of 'element * element list;`

Defining type constructors recursively:
```
datatype intlist = INTNIL | INTCONS of int * intlist;
INTNIL; (* represents an empty list *)
INTCONS (1, INTNIL); (* represents a list of just 1 *)
INTCONS (1, INTCONS (2, INTNIL)); (* represents a list of 1 and 2 *)

fun intlistLength INTNIL = 0
  | intlistLength (INTCONS (_,tail)) =
      1 + (intlistLength tail);
```
Creating a parameterized list type:
```
datatype 'element mylist = NIL | CONS of 'element * element mylist;

fun myfoldr f c NIL = c
  | myfoldr f c (CONS(a,b)) =
      f(a, myfoldr f c b);
```
Defining polymorphic binary trees:
```
datatype 'data tree = Empty | Node of 'data tree * 'data * 'data tree;
val treeEmpty = Empty;
val tree2 = Node(Empty, 2, Empty);
val tree 123 = Node(Node(Empty,1,Empty), 2, Node(Empty,3,Empty));
```
Binary tree operations:
```
fun sumall Empty = 0
  | sumall (Node(x,y,z)) =
      sumall x + y + sumall z;

fun isintree x Empty = false
  | isintree x (Node(l,y,r)) =
      x = y
      orelse isintree x l
      orelse isintree x r;
```
### OCaml Syntax
***

- in OCaml, statements are ended by the double semicolon `;;` rather than the single `;`

- literals:
  - `3.141;;` has type float
  - `'j';;` has type char
  - `(3, true, "hi");;` has type `int * bool * string`
  - `[1; 2; 3];;` has type `int list`

- operators:
  - negation operator is `-` instead of `~`
  - division operator for int is `/` instead of `div`
  - `-3 * (1+7) /2 mod 3`
  - `-1.0 /. 2.0 +. 1.9 *. 2`, float operations have an extra `.`
  - `a || b && c`

- variable definition:
  - uses `let` and `and` instead of `val`
  - `let name = ...`
  - `let a = 3 and b = 5 in ...`

- functions:
  - instead of `fun f x y = ...`, `let f x y = ...`
  - can use `function` syntactical sugar for pattern matching on a single parameter
  - can omit `fun` altogether
  - for anonymous functions, `fun x -> x * 2`
  - the `rec` is required for a recursive variable definition

`fib` in SML:
```
fun fib 0 = 0
  | fib 1 = 1
  | n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
```
`fib` in OCaml with full `fun`:
```
let rec fib = fun n ->
  if n < 2
  then n
  else fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
;;
```
`fib` in OCaml with `function` syntactic sugar for matching:
```
let rec fib = function
    0 -> 0
  | 1 -> 1
  | n -> fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
;;
```
`fib` in OCaml with fully abbreviated syntactic sugar:
```
let rec fib n =
  if n < 2
  then n
  else fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
;;
```
- type declarations:
  - uses `type` instead of `datatype`
  - `type 'a option = None | Some of 'a`

- pattern matching:
  - uses `match` instead of `case`
  - `match opt with None -> ... | Some x -> x`

- local declarations:
  -  `let x = 123 in let y = 321 in x + y` gives 444 with type int

- tuples:
  - cannot use `#` to index into tuple, instead use pattern matching

- lists:
  - uses `List.fold_left` and `List.fold_right` instead of `foldl` and `foldr`

- modules:
  - use `open` to open or import a module
  - `open List;;`, `length [1;2;3];;`
