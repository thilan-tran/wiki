# CS118: Computer Network Fundamentals
***

## Overview
***

- **computer networks** allow for interaction and communications between computers
  - requires certain hardware and software components
  - involves standardized **network protocols**
    - protocols are complex, with different layers, eg. application, transport, or link layers
    - used by developers for **network programming**
    - eg. the **TCP** and **IP** protocol suite used in the today's internet

- the **internet** is a global network for computers
  - hierarchal, has global, regional, and local levels
    - managed by different **internet service providers (ISP)**
  - *nuts and bolts* view:
    - **hosts** are the end systems running various network apps
      - billions of connected computing devices
      - clients *and* servers
    - **communication links**, eg. fiber, copper, radio
      - wired or wireless
      - each has an associated transmission rate and bandwidth
      - different types of connections, eg. phone-wireless, phone-base, router-router, router-server
    - **routers** and **switches**
      - deals with transferring **packets** ie. chunks of data
      - act as the in-between between hosts and do not run network apps
  - the **network edge** is made up of the hosts, access networks, and various physical media
  - the **network core** acts as a backbone that deals with actually transferring the data
    - consists of interconnected routers and the packet/circuit switching method used

### Access Networks
***

- **digital subscriber line (DSL)**:
  - uses the *existing* dedicated *telephone* line to connect to a central **DSL access multiplexer (DLSAM)**
    - **splitter** sends data on the DSL line through internet and voice on the DSL line to telephone net
    - DLSAM is handled by an ISP
  - requires a dedicated hardware device called a **DSL modem**
  - downstream transmission rate is usually *much faster* than the upstream transmission rate
    - based on user patterns, users typically download much more than they upload

- **cable network**:
  - alternatively, use the *television* line
  - *similarities* with DSL:
    - data and TV is *split* and transmitted at different frequencies over a shared cable distribution network
    - requires hardware device called **cable modem**
    - connected to a central **cable modem termination system (CMTS)** or **cable headend**
    - CMTS is handled by an ISP
    - asymmetric transmission rate
  - unlike DSL, multiple homes are connected via the cable network to the ISP's cable headend
    - access network is shared, instead of having dedicated access to the central office as with DSL

- **home network**:
  - a *lower* hierarchy of networks
  - within the home, a **wireless access point** is connected to the DSL or cable modem
    - various devices can *wirelessly* connect to the access point
    - speed of access point is slower than a direct *wired* connection
      - speed also dependent on the wifi card of the device connecting to the access point

- **enterprise access network** or **Ethernet**:
  - uses a special hardware device called an **Ethernet switch**
  - connected with ISP through some institutional link and router
  - allows for *much higher* possible transmission rates
  - end systems typically connect into Ethernet switch, eg. WiFi router and PC

- **wireless access networks**:
  - shared access networks that connect end systems to routers *wirelessly*
  - wireless **local area network (LAN)** can reach within a building (100 ft)
    - supports up to 450 Mbps rate
    - eg. 802.11 b/g/n
  - **wide-area wireless access** coverage is almost universal (10's km)
    - provided by a cellular operator
    - much slower, between 1 and 10 Mbps
    - eg. 4G, 5G, LTE

### Physical Media
***

- data is *physically* transferred using **bits** that propagate between transmitter/receiver pairs
- a **physical link** lies between the transmitter and receiver
  - eg. common **twisted pair** with two insulated copper wires
- **guided media**:
  - signals propagate through *solid* media, eg. copper, fiber, coax
  - coax cable is made of concentric conductors, allows for bidirectionality
    - supports multiple channels, **hybrid fiber coax (HFC)**
  - fiber optic cable is a glass fiber carrying light pulses to represent bits
    - allows for extremely high-speed operation
    - *immune* to electromagnetic noise
- **unguided media**:
  - signals carried freely through electromagnetic spectrum
    - no physical wire
  - has issues of reflection, obstruction, inteference
  - eg. LAN, wide-area, satellite

### Network Core
***

- the **network core** is a mesh of interconnected routers
  - its role is to send **packets** or chunks of data between hosts

- two key *functions*:
  - **forwarding** relays packets from a router's input to the appropriate router output
  - **routing** determines the source-destination route taken by packets
    - these routes are computed locally and proactively, and are stored within the router

- key *technologies*:
  - **packet switching**:
    - hosts *break* application-layer messages into packets
    - packets are forwarded between routers, across links, from source to destination
      - packets *hop* through a certain number of intermediate nodes
    - each packet is transmitted *back-to-back*, not simultaneously, allowing for **full link capacity** transferrence
      - sending packets takes time (L bits) / (transmission rate R bits/sec)
    - entire packet must arrive before it can be transmitted (**store and forward**)
      - thus, the *end-to-end* delay is therefore *scaled* to the number of hops the packet must make
  - alternatively, **circuit switching**:
    - used in traditional telephone networks
    - no packets, switching granularity is in terms of **circuits**
    - resources/circuits are *dedicated* for a particular call
    - reservation-based, no sharing of an in-use circuit
    - circuits are *released* on call completion
  - *sharing between users* with circuit switching:
    - with **frequency division multiplexing (FDM)**, split up frequency domain
    - alternatiely, with **time division multiplexing (TDM)**, use time slices and time sharing

- why is packet switching used by the internet over circuit switching?
  - circuit switching is less **robust**, in that if a part of a circuit fails, it may break the entire network
    - on the other hand, with packet switching, the network infrastructure is maintained even if some routers go down
  - packet switching also allows for *more users* to use the network
    - many users will be *idle* for a percentage of their time on the network
    - eg. with a 1 Mbs link, and each user using 100 Kbs and active 10% of the time:
      - this user pattern is an example of *bursty data*
      - for circuit switching, can only support up to 1 Mbs / 100 Kbs = 10 users at a time (*dedicated* circuits)
      - for packet switching, can support 35 users with a probability that > 10 are active that is less than 0.0004
  - the probability that x users are active is: $P(N,x) = \binom{N}{x}p^x(1-p)^{N-x}$
    - in order to afford a certain number of users, the probability that more than the threshold number of users are active at the same time should be extremely small
  - however, excessive **congestion** is still possible with packet switching:
    - packet delay and loss may occur when the network becomes overloaded with active users
      - packets may have to jump more links in order to alleviate network congestion
    - thus, certain protocols are needed for reliable data transfer and congestion control
  - ie. circuit switching uses *reserved* resources and allows for consistent service, while packet switching uses *on-demand* allocation and less guaranteed service

### Packet Delay, Loss, and Throughput
***

- if the arrival rate to a link *exceeds* the transmission rate for a time:
  - packets will **queue**, and await transmission
    - the **queuing delay** is the time waited in the buffer before transmitted
    - *different* from **transmission delay**, the total amount of time to transmit all bits of a packet
  - packets can then be **lost** or dropped if the memory buffer for the queue fills up

- thus **packet delay** overall has multiple sources:
  - **processing delay** from checking bit errors and determining output link
  - **queuing delay** from awaiting transmission, depends on congestion
    - as (L bits * a average arrival rate) / R rate approaches 1, queuing delay becomes large
    - above 1, the average delay becomes infinite
  - **transmission delay** is how long it takes to push out all bits of the packet, depends on packet size
    - L bits / R rate
  - **propagation delay** is the time for a bit to actually travel to another router
    - d length / s speed

- the `traceroute` program provides delay measurement from source to destination
  - send three probe packet that reaches each router along the path
  - measures time interval between transmission and reply

- handling **packet loss**:
  - when a packet is lost, the source must slow its transmission, and also retransmit the lost packet
    - different *response* for different *applications*:
      - eg. for video streaming, the media will buffer and prioritize lower delay and allow dropping of some packets
      - eg. for emails and communications, delay is not as important as data integrity
  - the exact response is dictated by different transmission protocols eg. TCP

- the **throughput** is the rate at which bits are transferred between sender and receiver
  - can be *instantaneous* or *average*
  - often constrained by the slowest **bottleneck link** in the network

### The Internet
***

- the **internet** is built as a network of networks
- given *millions* of access ISPs, how should they be connected to one another?
  1. pairwise connections, ie. connect each ISP to every other
    - fully distributed and requires $O(n^2)$ connections
    - this solution doesn't scale
  2. connect each ISP to a *global* transit ISP
    - full centralized solution
    - this global ISP becomes a *bottleneck* as all traffic passes through it
  3. use *multiple* global ISPs
    - a natural byproduct of a single global ISP from competition
    - each only serves a subset of its local networks
    - requires **peering links** and **internet exchange points (IXP)** between the global ISPs
      - IXP are managed by a third party
      - note that these are less of a bottleneck since global ISPs want to minimize user interaction with another ISP
  4. *hiearchical* structure
    - this is the current structure of the internet
    - at a lower level, several access ISPs are connected to a global ISP through a **regional net**
    - creates a **hierarchy** from access ISPs, to regional nets, to global ISPs
    - another unique level is the **content provider network** eg. Google that brings services and content directly to end users, bypassing the hiearchy
    - this structure is motiviated more by business concerns than technical concerns
