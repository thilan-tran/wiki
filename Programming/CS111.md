## Introduction to OS
***

- **Von Neumann** model of computing:
  - when a program is run, the processor repeatedly *fetches* an instruction from memory, *decodes* it, and *executes* it

- the **operating system (OS)** is in charge of making the system operates correctly and efficiently in an *abstracted*, easy-to-use manner:
  - uses technique of **virtualization** to transform a *physical* resource into a generalized, easy-to-use *virtual* form
    - OS thus also known as **virtual machine**
    - eg. in order to virtualize memory, each running program seems to have its own private memory, instead of sharing the actual physical memory
  - provides interfaces and **system calls** in a **standard library** that users can use
  - acts as a **resource manager** to manage resources such as the CPU, memory, and disk
  - virtualizes the CPU, ie. turning a small number of CPUs into infinite CPUs that can run many programs at once
    - this **concurrency** can lead to different problems for the OS itself as well as **multi-threaded** programs that require certain mechanisms to solve
  - handles data **persistence** with the file system and I/O
- basic OS goals include **abstraction**, minimizing **overhead** (ie. in time or space), providing **protection** and **isolation** between applications, and high **reliability**
- the OS code is *unique* from application code:
  - eg. applications should not be able to read from anywhere on disk
  - thus, OS should distinguish between:
    - **system calls** that require formal hardware instructions to use the OS (ie. jumps into the *kernel* mode and raises hardware privelege level)
    - **procedure calls** that are provided as a library and are accessible in the *user* mode
