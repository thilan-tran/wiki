# FPGA
***

- a **field-programmable gate array (FPGA)** is an integrated circuit:
    - designed to be configured after manufacturing
    - AKA programmable circuit
    - components include:
        - logic blocks for implementing combinational and sequential logic
        - interconnects ie. wires for connecting input blocks to logic blocks
        - I/O blocks forexternal connections
    - many applications, useful for prototyping

- FPGA design fundamentals:
    1. design:
        - create modules and define interations between modules
        - control logic and state machine drawings
        - define external I/O
    2. implementation:
        - express each module in HDL source code
        - connect modules in a hierarchical manner
    3. simulation:
        - important debugging tool for FPGA
        - fast to quickly simulate
    4. logic synthesis:
        - a logic synthesis tool analyzes the design and generates a netlist with common cells available to FPGA target
        - converting software to hardware
            - netlist should be functionally equivalent to the original source code
        - done by XST from ISE
    5. technology mapping:
        - synthesized netlist is mapped to device-specific libraries
        - creates another netlist closer to the final target device
        - done by NGDBUILD from ISE
    6. cell placement:
        - the cells instantiated by the final netlist are placed in teh FPGA layout
        - can be time-consuming
        - done by MAP from ISE
    7. route:
        - AKA place-and-route in combination with cell placement
        - connecting the cells in the device to match the netlist
        - done by PAR from ISE
    8. bitstream generation:
        - produces a programming file AKA a **bitstream** to program the FPGA
        - ie. compiling a FPGA design
        - done by BITGEN from ISE

# Verilog
***

- **Verilog** overview:
    - similar to C eg. case sensitive, same comment style and operators
    - two standards Verilog-1995 and Verilog-2001
    - VHDL is another widely used hardware definitiion language (HDL)

- Verilog has historically served two functions:
    1. create **synthesizable code** ie. describe your digital logic design in a high-level way instead of using schematics
    2. create **behavioral code** to model elements that interact with your design
        - ie. testbenches and models

- data types:
    - main data types are `wire` and `reg`
    - must be declared before used
    - the `wire` type models a basic wire that holds transient values:
        - changing the value on the RHS changes the LHS
        - only wires can be used on the LHS of continuous assign statement
        - default is wire type
    - the `reg` type is anything that stores a value
        - only regs can be used on the LHS of non-continuous assign statements

- data values:
    - values include `1, 0, x/X, z/Z`
        - `x` is an unknown value, `z` represents a high impedance value
    - radices include `d, h, o, b`
    - format is `<size>'<radix><value>`:
        - eg. `8'h7B, 'b111_1011, 'd123`
        - underscores have no value, purely for readability

- operators:
    - bitwise operators eg. `~, &, |, ^, ~^`
    - reduction operators are bitwise operations on a *single* operand and produce one bit result
    - logical operators eg. `!, &&, ||, ==, !=, ===, !==`
        - triple equals also compare `x, z`
    - arithmetic operators eg. `+, -, *, /, %`
    - shift operators `<<, >>, <<<, >>>`
        - `<<` logical, `<<<` arithmetic
    - conditional operator `sel ? a : b`
    - concatenation operator `{a, b}`
    - replication operator `{n{m}}`
    - assignment operator `= <=`
        - in a block assignment `=`, assignment is immediate
        - in a non-blocking assignment `<=`, assignment are deferred until all right hand sides has been evaluated, closer to actual hardware behavior

- assignment operator guidelines:
    - for pure sequential logic, use non-blocking
    - for pure combination logic, use blocking
    - do not mix block and non-blocking in the same always block
    - both sequential and combination logic in the same always block, use non-blocking

- a **module** is the basic building block:
    1. define input, output, inout ports
    2. signal declarations eg. `wire [3:0] a;`
    3. concurrent logic blocks:
        - continuous assignments
            - can leave off `assign` keyword for shorthand
        - always block, either sequential or combinatorial
        - initial blocks, used in behavioral modeling
        - forever blocks, used in behavioral modeling
        - continuous assignments are used for assigning to wires
            - all other blocks are used for assigning to registers
    4. instantiations of sub-modules

Example module:
```verilog
module top(a, b, ci, s, co);
    input a, b, ci;
    output s, co;

    wire s;
    reg g, p, co;

    assign s = a ^ b ^ ci;
    // combinatorial always block using begin/end
    always @* begin // @* is the sensitivity list
        g = a & b;
        p = a | b;
        co = g | (p & ci);
    end
endmodule
```
- the sensitivity list defines when to enter the function in the `begin/end` block
    1. when level sensitive, changes to any signals in the list will invoke the always block, used in combinational circuits
        - eg. `always @ (a or b), always @*`
    2. when edge sensitive, invoke always block on specified signal edges, used in sequential circuits
        - eg. `always @ (posedge clk or posedge reset)`

- always blocks:
    - an `if/else` or case statement may fail to cover all cases
        - add a `default` statement or put statement before case
    - can loop with `while, for, repeat`

Example modulo 64 counter:
```verilog
module counter(clk, rst, out);
    input clk, rst;
    output [5:0] out;

    reg [5:0] out;
    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
    begin
        if (rst)
            out <= 6'b000000;
        else
            out <= out + 1;
    end
endmodule
```
- module instantiation:
    - using other modules within one module
    - restrictions:
        - port order doesn't matter
        - unused output port allowed
        - name must be unique
    - eg. `counter counter1(.clk(test_clk), .rst(test_rst), .out(out));`

Full-adder example using module instantiation:
```verilog
module half_adder(a, b, x, y);
    input a, b;
    output x, y;
    assign x = a & b;
    assign y = a ^ b;
endmodule

module full_adder(a, b, ci, s, co);
    input a, b, ci;
    output s, co;
    wire g, p, pc;
    half_adder(h1(.a(a), .b(b), .x(g), .y(p));
    half_adder(h2(.a(p), .b(ci), .x(pc), .y(s));
    assign co = pc | g;
endmodule
```
- testbench:
    1. instantiate unit under test AKA `uut`
    2. provide inputs
    3. simulate and verify behavior

Testbench example:
```verilog
reg clk, rst;
wire out;
counter uut(.clk(clk), .rst(rst), .out(out));

initial begin
    // assign inputs
end
always begin
    // alternatively, initial with forever block
    #5 clk = ~clk; // every 5 ms, update clk
end
```

# FPGA Implementation
***

- **programmable logic devices (PLDs)** are the larger family of devices that contain FPGAs:
    - alternative to custom **application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)**
    - *pros*:
        - designs can be rapidly loaded onto PLDs, unlike slow and expensive ASIC development process
    - *cons*:
        - the hidden programmable logic for connecting logic blocks are slower, more expensive, and consume more power
        - when high clock frequencies and very dense logic gates are required, only ASICs can be used
            - on the other hand, when logic is not very dense, the chip may have a minimum area determined by the number of I/O pads ie. pad limited, so PLD may still even be cheaper

- **generic array logic (GAL)** devices:
    - any logical expression can be represented as a sum of products
    - GALs provide a programmable array of AND and OR gates
        - every input and inverted input is pulled into AND gates, and groups of these products are fed into separate OR gates
    - modern GALs use EEPROM technology and CMOS switches to allow for reprogrammability
        - past technology used fuses that could only be "blown" ie. programmed once
    - in the AND array, connections can be programmed so that the input term is disconnected from the AND input
        - then, the OR connections can be hardwired since the AND array is fully programmable
    - a structure called a **macrocell** performs other configurations such as OR / NOR polarities and selecting flip-flops
        - ie. determines how the boolean expression is handled and how the associated pins operate
    - to implement a GAL, HDL is converted into a netlist that is then fitted to a target device to create a **fuse map**
    - *pros*:
        - simplicity
    - *cons*:
        - rigidity, with respect to timing or design size
        - very high scaling in cost vs. logic density
            - AND matrix increases in square function of I/O terms

- **complex PLDs (CPLDs)** are the more common macrocell-based PLDs in the industry today:
    - CPLDs have a linear scaling of connectivity to logic density by using a segmented architecture with multipled fixed-size GAL-style logic blocks
    - more scalable because the logic blocks are fixed in size and small enough:
        - sometimes just 5 product terms per macrocell
            - product term sharing allows a macrocell to borrow terms from neighboring cells
        - switch matrix does become more complicated with more pins
    - best for control paths that only require small number of flip-flops
        - eg. small state machines, small registers, control logic
    - *pros*:
        - simplicity
        - better scaling than GALs
    - *cons*:
        - more complex fitting process than GALs due to hierarchical structure and macrocell sharing
        - still limited to simpler control path applications

- **field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)** are devices that address data path applications:
    - consists of an array of small logic cells, each with a flip-flop, lookup table (LUT), and supporting logic for multiplexing and arithmetic carries
        - boolean expressions can be evaluated through the LUTs, which are implemented as small SRAM arrays
    - cells are arranged on a grid of routing resources that can make connections between arbitrary cells to build logic paths
        - I/O cells are located around the edges of the chip
    - very high logic densities are achieved by scaling the cell array
    - routing now becomes the limiting factor due to the grid interconnect system:
        - routing can an especially long amount of time
        - large, fast designs require iterative routing and placement algorithms
    - a new issue is with skew across the large system:
        - most FPGAs support several global clocks
        - phase or delay locked loops can be used to intentionally de-skew clock signals
    - other FPGA considerations:
        - RAM blocks that can be used in arbitrary width and depth configurations for different purposes
            - also, using logic cells as RAM
        - third-party logic cores
        - I/O cell architecture


# FPGA Performance
***

- the FPGA is a general-purpose device with digital logic building blocks:
    - basic building block is a **logic cell or element (LC/LE)** which contains a look-up table and flip-flop
    - dedicated logic blocks, internal memory, buses, peripherals, controllers, and even processors can be constructed form this general-purpose FPGA logic
        - a processor built with LCs is called a **soft processor**, and must be synthesized and placed
    - *pros*:
        - high level of customization
            - any custom combination of peripherals and controllers
        - soft processors allow for obsolescence mitigation since the processor HDL code is permanent
        - FPGA component versatility allows larger systems to be reduced into a single FPGA
            - reduced components and cost
        - option for hardware acceleration for any software bottlenecks
            - FPGA design tools allow C code to be easily adapted into hardware
    - *cons*:
        - requires additional design by the embedded programmer compared to a traditional off-the-shelf processor
        - design tools are more complex
        - FPGA is more expensive than equivalent processor
            - but can take advantage of FPGA already in the system at no additional cost

## Performance Enhancing Techniques
***

### Non-FPGA Specific

- the first set of techniques are code manipulation strategies:
    1. compiler optimization levels:
        - optimizations include jump and pop, loop unrolling, function in-lining, etc.
        - level 2 is standard, performs all optimizations that do not increase code size
        - level 3 is the highest level that includes all optimizations that can increase code size
    2. manufacturers provide some optimized instructions for FPGAs, eg. `xil_printf` which is 5% the size of the standard `printf`, with some limitations
    3. assembly and in-line assembly is supported
    4. other optimizations such as locality of reference, small data sections, loop length, minimal recursion

- the remaining techniques deal with different memory usages:
    - the fastest option is to put everything in local memory called **BlockRAM (BRAM)**:
        - essentially L1 or L2 cache of the system
        - usually between 32-64 KB
    - the slowest option is to put everything in external memory only:
        - eg. SRAM, SDRAM, or DDR SDRAM
        - incurs memory access time as well as peripheral bus latency
    - if the entire program cannot fit in local memory, we can consider caching external memory:
        - for some systems, such as MicroBlaze architectures, the cache memory is not dedicated silicon but instead constructed from BRAM and LCs
            - this reduces the system frequency since the cache controller adds additional logic and complexity
        - thus, enabling the MicroBlaze cache may improve performance, even with a slower system clock, but can also detract from performance
            - multiple cache misses make it so cached external memory performances even worse than external memory without cache
    - thus, the best performance solution in terms of memory for MicroBlaze systems usually involves partitioning code:
        - critical data, instructions, and stack are placed in local memory, with everything else in external memory
        - data cache is not used, allowing for a larger local memory
        - instruction cache can be used if instructions cannot fit in local memory

### FPGA Specific

- one class of techniques deal with increasing the FPGA operating frequency:
    1. only connecting utilized peripherals and buses
        - eg. disabling debug logic modules, using trimmed address buses, simpler GPIO pin version, etc.
    2. specifying area and timing constraints so that the FPGA place and route tools perform better

- the remaining techniques deal with hardware acceleration:
    - hardware acceleration consumes additional FPGA resources, but allows some software limitations to be overcome
    1. modules such as dividers and barrel-shifters can be customized to be done in hardware instead of software
        - this consumes more logic but improves performance
    2. arbitrary software bottlenecks can be converted to hardware:
        - custom hardware logic can be designed to offload an FPGA embedded processor
        - usually facilitated by low-latency access points onto the processor
        - tools exist that generate FPGA hardware directly from C code
        - eg. FFT, DES and AES encryption, matrix manipulation, etc.
