***

## Bossa Nova
***

### Overiew
- **Bossa Nova** - a style of Brazilian samba
  - developed in Rio
  - *softer and slower* than carnival samba
- became performed in jazz clubs / gatherings
- *notable musicians*:
  - Antonia Carlos Jobim, Joao Gilberto, Vinivius de Moraes

#### Antonio Carlos Jobim
- most important composer of the era
- started piano at 14, went to architecture school, but switched to music
- inspired and influenced by *classical music*, not jazz
- became professional piano player
- composed *Sinfonia do Rio de Janeiro* in 1954
  - attempt to fuse classical and popular music
- in 1956 started collaborating with Vinicius (poet / political figure) and Gilberto (guitarist)
  - *established* prototype of Bossa Nova lyrics / vocal / guitar styles
  - *Girl from Ipanema* won a Grammy in 1965

### Origins
- social setting in Rio set up for a new style of Brazilian music
  - would appeal to upper class when organizing musical gatherings
  - were fans of Frank Sinatra / Stan Kenton (modern, progressive jazz)
- but sounds created by Jobim / Gilberto emerged
  - youth became fan base of new musical movement
- called a new way / new voice
  - but was a descendant of other types of samba: *samba cancao*
    - a songwriter's style of writing
    - eg. Ary Barroso's *Pra Machucar Meu Caracao*
    - later re-recorded in Bossa Nova style by Stan Getz and Gilberto

#### vs. Samba
- Bossa Nova played in *more intimate* settings
- *smaller* instrumentations
  - eg. guitar, jazz trio, small ensemble
  - few hand-held percussion instruments
- soft intimate voice

### Popularity
- film **Orfeu Negro** (1959) made Bossa Nova musicians international stars
  - wins Cannes film festival, uses album by Jobin
  - introduced Bossa Nova to the whole world
- *criticisms*: called a fad, oversimplifcation

#### Transition to the USA
- Bossa Nova craze started in early 1960's
- jazz musicians toured Brazil and became *exposed* to Samba / Bossa Nova
- **Charlie Byrd** (not Bird) decided to do a record with saxophonist **Stan Getz**
  - *Jazz Samba* (1962) recording of music of Jobim, Barroso, and others
    - popular record, one track made it to Billboard and won a Grammy

  - opened doors for Brazilian musicians
- *Getz / Gilberto* (1963)
  - Getz was the only non-brazilian player
  - all tracks became hits, eg. *The Girl from Ipanema*

### End of Bossa Nova
- musical era ended after military coup against the president of Brazil
- led to a student reaction against the coup and rejection of Bossa Nova
  - previously the biggest supporters
  - argued Bossa Nova didn't accurately depict reality, too *poetic / innnocent*
